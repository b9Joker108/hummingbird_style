A "Dakshiki Happy Day African male colourful shirt" most likely refers to a vibrant, colorful African dashiki shirt designed for men, often made with bold, traditional West African patterns and embroidery. These shirts are typically loose-fitting and made of cotton, suitable for casual wear or cultural events.

- Afrovillage offers colorful dashiki shirts sourced directly from Ghana, priced around AU $56, with loose fit design suitable for casual and performance wear [1].
- Other retailers like Hurly Burly in Perth sell authentic 100% cotton oversized dashiki shirts in various colors for about $45 AUD, ideal for African, hip-hop, and international party wear [4].

The dashiki shirt is known for its bright, intricate African embroidery and versatile use in fashion, often celebrated for cultural appreciation and festive occasions [2][3][5]. 

If in Melbourne or broadly in Australia, these options can be explored online or in cultural clothing stores for an authentic, colorful African male dashiki shirt.
