Professor Keith Baar: Please identify all the textbooks and readings required for Prof. Baar's uni units?

Professor Keith Baar’s courses at the University of California, Davis (Departments of Physiology and Membrane Biology and Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior) primarily focus on **molecular exercise physiology**, **muscle and tendon adaptation**, and **biochemistry of training response**. His teaching and research are typically offered through the **Molecular, Cellular, and Integrative Physiology (MCIP 200-series)** and **Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior (NPB) units**.

### Required and Recommended Textbooks / Readings

1. **Textbooks frequently assigned or referenced**:
   - *Skeletal Muscle: Form and Function*, 3rd edition, by Brian R. MacIntosh, Phillip F. Gardiner, and Alan J. McComas.  
   - *Exercise Physiology: Nutrition, Energy, and Human Performance*, 9th edition, by William D. McArdle, Frank I. Katch, and Victor L. Katch.  
   - *Molecular Biology of the Cell* (Alberts et al.) — especially in graduate MCIP courses focusing on gene expression and tissue adaptation.  
   - *Biochemistry*, by Berg, Tymoczko, Gatto, and Stryer, used for molecular background segments in MCIP 201/290.  

2. **Key reading articles and review papers (rotating selections):**
   - Baar, K. (2010). “The signalling underlying FITness.” *European Journal of Sport Science* — on mTOR and AMPK regulation of muscle growth.  
   - Baar, K., & Esser, K. A. (1999). “Phosphorylation of p70(S6k) correlates with increased skeletal muscle mass following resistance exercise.” *FASEB Journal*.  
   - Atherton, P. J., & Baar, K. (2006). “Mechanisms of human skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy.” *Cell Biochemistry and Biophysics*.  
   - Baar, K. (2014). “Nutrition and the adaptation to endurance and resistance training.” *Sports Medicine*.  

3. **Supplementary materials**:
   - Lecture notes and curated journal selections posted to UC Davis Canvas.  
   - Review compilations from *Journal of Applied Physiology*, *FASEB Journal*, and *Frontiers in Physiology* for reading assignments tied to current lab findings.

### Context

Keith Baar’s teachings integrate **molecular and applied physiology**, often blending **biochemical signaling (mTOR, AMPK, FOXO)** with **training adaptation** for skeletal muscle and connective tissue. His graduate supervision is part of the **Biochemistry, Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (BMCDB)** and **Integrative Physiology** graduate groups, where canonical biochemistry and tissue biomechanics textbooks are supplemented by peer-reviewed papers instead of traditional textbooks, especially in advanced MCIP seminars [1].

In summary, while specific course versions may vary annually, the above list accurately reflects the **standard textbooks and core readings** across Keith Baar’s teaching portfolio at UC Davis.
