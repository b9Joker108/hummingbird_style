Short procedural cue (practical essence)
1. Step one foot far forward from a standing base so feet are staggered.  
2. Bend the front knee until the thigh approaches horizontal while the back leg remains extended with the heel lifted.  
3. Square the hips forward and lift the torso; reach arms overhead or place hands on the floor beside the front foot as required by the sequence.  
4. Breathe steadily and hold for several breaths, then switch sides.

Key alignment cues and emphasis
- Front knee tracks over the ankle; avoid letting it collapse inward.  
- Hips aim to face forward; draw the back hip slightly forward to deepen the stretch in the front hip flexor.  
- Pelvis and core engage to protect the low back; lengthen the spine rather than overarching.  
- Back leg remains active through the heel and thigh to stabilize and create the “lunge” feeling.  
- Arms and chest may open overhead to encourage thoracic extension and balance.

---

Primary effects and common uses
- Stretches hip flexors (psoas) of the back leg.  
- Strengthens quadriceps, gluteus, core and stabilizers.  
- Improves balance and prepares the body for standing sequences (e.g., Sun Salutation variations).  
- Used as a transitional or preparatory pose in vinyasa and Hatha flows.

---

Contraindications and caution
- Proceed cautiously with recent knee, hip, or low-back injuries.  
- Modify depth or use hands on blocks if balance or knee pain occurs.  
- Keep the front knee protected by avoiding excessive forward translation of the knee beyond the toes.
