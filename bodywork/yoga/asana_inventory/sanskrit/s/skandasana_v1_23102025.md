  - "Hip opener"
primary_benefits:
  - "Stretches hamstrings"
  - "Opens hips and adductors"
  - "Builds leg strength and ankle stability"
  - "Improves balance and core engagement"
  - "Enhances lateral mobility and functional flexibility"
contraindications:
  - "Acute knee injuries"
  - "Recent hip surgery"
  - "Severe ankle instability"
  - "Disc herniation with radiating symptoms (practice cautiously)"
recommended_props:
  - "Yoga block"
  - "Blanket"
  - "Chair"
  - "Wall (for balance)"
alignment_cues:
  - "Start in a wide-legged stance with toes turned slightly out."
  - "Shift weight to one leg; bend deeply into the bent knee while extending the other leg laterally with toes pointing up."
  - "Keep the torso upright and long; draw the navel to the spine to engage core."
  - "Press evenly through the outer edge of the extended foot and the heel or ball of the bent foot depending on variation."
  - "Modify by placing a block under the hands to lift the torso and protect the knee."
step_by_step:
  - "1. Begin in Tadasana and widen the stance to a comfortable long-legged position."
  - "2. Turn both feet slightly outward; root through both heels."
  - "3. Shift the weight to the right leg and bend the right knee deeply, lowering the hips toward the right heel."
  - "4. Simultaneously straighten the left leg, flex the left foot so the toes point up, and draw the inner left thigh long."
  - "5. Keep the chest lifted; place hands on the ground, a block, or bring palms to prayer at the heart for balance."
  - "6. Hold for 3–8 breaths, breathing into the side body and the hamstrings of the extended leg."
  - "7. To exit, press into the feet, straighten the bent leg, return to center, and repeat on the opposite side."
modifications_and_assists:
  - "Beginner: place a block under the hand on the bent-leg side for balance and to reduce depth."
  - "Protect knees: keep heel of bent leg lifted slightly if full heel grounding causes discomfort."
  - "Chair-supported: perform a side lunge while holding the back of a chair for balance."
  - "Advanced: lower the hips closer to the ground, bring the chest toward the bent knee, or experiment with a twist and bind across the bent leg."
common_mistakes:
  - "Collapsing the chest forward instead of maintaining an upright torso."
  - "Allowing the bent knee to track too far past the toes."
  - "Turning the extended foot outward instead of keeping it flexed and toes pointing upward."
  - "Overweighting the extended leg and losing stability on the bent-leg side."
variations:
  - "Skandasana with hands on block"
  - "Skandasana to lunge flow (dynamic side-to-side)"
  - "Low Skandasana (deep side squat) for advanced practitioners"
  - "Bound Skandasana with arm bind around bent leg"
preparatory_poses:
  - "Malasana"
  - "Wide-Legged Forward Fold (Prasarita Padottanasana)"
  - "Utthita Trikonasana"
  - "Low Lunge (Anjaneyasana)"
follow_up_poses:
  - "Baddha Konasana"
  - "Pigeon Pose (Eka Pada Rajakapotasana)"
  - "Prasarita Padottanasana"
  - "Standing forward fold to neutralize hamstrings"
anatomy_focus:
  - "Primary muscles stretched: hamstrings; adductors; gluteus medius/minimus."
  - "Primary muscles engaged: quadriceps; gluteus maximus; tibialis anterior; intrinsic foot stabilizers; core stabilizers (transverse abdominis, obliques)."
energetic_and_traditional_notes:
  - "Name derives from Skanda, a Vedic/Puranic figure associated with warrior energy suggesting readiness and lateral strength."
  - "Used in many modern vinyasa and Hatha sequences as both a functional preparatory pose and a transition for lateral mobility."
pedagogy_tips_for_teachers:
  - "Cue students to find a stable base before increasing depth; prioritize knee tracking and neutral spine."
  - "Use side-to-side sequencing to develop dynamic balance and to reveal asymmetries between left and right."
  - "Offer tactile support at the hip or a visual cue to keep the extended toes flexed."
cultural_and_lineage_notes:
  - "Terminology and precise alignment vary by lineage; some schools use 'Skandasana' to refer to an Iyengar seated variation; clarify the intended form when teaching."

# Skandasana #

## Nomenclature, Othography and Etymology ##

'Skandasana' (Sanskrit: स्कन्दासन ; IAST: skandāsana; English: 'Skanda posture')

Skandasana, also known as Side Lunge or Half Squat, is a yoga pose that involves a deep side lunge with one leg bent and the other extended. It strengthens the lower body, improves flexibility in the hips and hamstrings and enhances balance. This asymmetrical pose can be challenging, but variations exist to make it more accessible.  

## How to practice Skandasana ##

1. Start: Stand with a wide-legged stance at the top of your mat. 
2. Shift weight: Shift your weight to one side, bending the knee and lowering your hips toward your heel. 
3. Extend the other leg: Keep the opposite leg straight with the foot either on the floor or with the toes lifted toward the ceiling. 
4. Hand position: Place your hands on the floor for balance, or bring them together at your heart in a prayer position. 
5. Maintain alignment: Keep your spine long, chest lifted, and the weight in the heel of your bent leg. 
6. Repeat: To switch sides, shift your weight to the other leg. 

## Benefits of Skandasana ##

* Strengthens: Quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and inner thighs. 
* Improves flexibility: Stretches the hamstrings, adductors, and groin. 
* Enhances balance: Challenges and improves your balance and stability. 
* Opens hips: Helps to open and mobilize the hip joints, which can help relieve lower back issues. 

## Modifications and tips ##

* For support: If your heel comes up off the floor, place a blanket or block underneath it for support. 
* To prevent rocking: To avoid leaning too far forward, place a wall behind you and use it to help keep your chest lifted and your hips back. 
* Engage your straight leg: Keep the straight leg active and engaged for stability. 
* Go halfway: If you can't go all the way down, simply work from a half-lunge position and gradually increase the depth as you build strength and flexibility.
