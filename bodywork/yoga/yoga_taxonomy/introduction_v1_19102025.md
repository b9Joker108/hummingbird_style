# Yoga Taxonomy #

Please generate an informed, defensible and deeply triangulated taxonomy of traditional yoga forms founded on lineage, etc., and on this foundation, integrate non-traditional, modern, contemporary and informed/inspired hybridations in YAML please.

Here is a deeply triangulated and historically grounded YAML taxonomy of yoga systems. It integrates the **traditional lineages and philosophical foundations** (Vedic, Shaiva, Shakta, Vaishnava, Buddhist, Jain, etc.) with their **post-classical and modern adaptations**, culminating in **contemporary, scientific, and hybridized modalities** that reinterpret traditional aims [15][19][20][18].

This taxonomy positions each yoga category historically, philosophically, and functionally—**from proto-Vedic integrations of sacrifice and meditation** through the **Śaiva–Śākta physiological renaissance of the medieval period**, into the **globalized, interdisciplinary fusions of the 20th–21st centuries**. It acknowledges both **lineage transmission** and **vernacular hybridization**, reflecting modern evidence-based reinterpretations of yoga as a living, continuously adaptive system [15][19][18][20].
