# Bodywork: Props and Affordances - An Introduction #

Throughout my exploration of many branches of the vast tree of the Dharmic Traditions, I have come to appreciate a recurring trope or framework that manifests repeatedly throughout in different guises, stated simply it is sadhana conducted with support and/or without. This is evident in different evocations and subtraditions of the Vedic Tradition, Jainadharma, Baudhadharma, Shaivadharma, Shaktadharma, Vaishnavadharma and Sikhadharma, amongst others. It is evident in meditation, puja, deity worship, philosophy, logic, mantra sadhana, ritual, all limbs of the traditional and canonical Yoga Darshana and the other traditional Six Darshanas and are evident in both Right-handed sadhana disciplines, as well as Left-handed. Please survey. Use Sanskrit technical terms in Devanagari and IAST as required.

Your observation regarding the recurring polarity of *sādhanā* (साधना / sādhana)—whether undertaken *with support* (सोपाय sā‑upāya) or *without support* (निर्उपाय nir‑upāya)—touches a profound and pan‑Indic metaphysical grammar that underlies the Dharmic traditions in their various institutional and experiential forms. Across Vedānta, Śaiva and Śākta tantra, Bauddha and Jaina praxis, and even Sikh and Nātha formulations, this structural duality persists: the tension between *upāya* (means, method, support) and *anupāya* (direct, selfless realisation).

### Meaning and Structure of Sādhanā

The term *sādhanā* (साधना) derives from the verbal root *√sādh*, meaning “to accomplish” or “to bring to completion” [1][3][6]. It refers to any disciplined method that transforms consciousness—ritual (*kriyā*), meditation (*dhyāna*), devotion (*bhakti*), action (*karma*), or knowledge (*jñāna*). The practitioner, or *sādhaka* (साधक), engages in sustained *abhyāsa* (अभ्यास, repeated disciplined practice), guided by *śraddhā* (faith), *guru‑upadeśa* (instruction), and *niyama* (restraint).

### Two Modalities of Sādhanā: With and Without Support

This polarity—*sādhanā sā‑upāya* and *sādhanā nir‑upāya*—is pervasive:

- In **Śaiva Tantra**, Abhinavagupta’s *Tantrāloka* differentiates *upāya* (व्युत्पन्नोपाय)–based practice (through mantra, visualization, ritual) from *anupāya* (अनुपाय), the spontaneous realization where no technique is operative, the state of *śāmbhavopāya* (divine awareness) transcending method.
  
- In **Bauddha Dharma**, especially in Vajrayāna, *upāya‑kauśalya* (उपाय‑कौशल्य, skilful means) is balanced by *prajñā* (wisdom). While method generates transformation, the highest realization (*anuttara‑yoga*) moves beyond even the concept of method—hence *upāya* and *anupāya* become unified in non‑dual gnosis.

- In **Vedānta**, the trajectory of *sādhana‑catuṣṭaya‑sampatti* (साधन‑चतुष्टय‑संपत्ति)—viveka, vairāgya, śamādi‑ṣaṭka‑sampatti, mumukṣutva—serves as the preparatory *upāya* leading to *ātma‑jñāna*. The final *aparokṣānubhūti* (direct knowledge) is *nir‑upāya*—self‑revealing, requiring no instrument.

- In **Śāktadharma**, the polarity manifests as *vidyā‑upāsanā* (guided invocation with supports such as mantra, yantra, deity) and *nirvikalpā‑samādhi*, the formless awareness without external medium.

- In **Jainadharma**, parallels arise between *śubha‑yoga* and *śuddha‑yoga*: the former employs disciplined supports (restraint, meditation objects), while the latter arises when even meditation’s duality dissolves, leading to *kevala‑jñāna*.

- In **Sikhī**, *simran* (स्मरण, remembrance of the nām) can begin as supported repetition (nāma‑japa) and culminate in spontaneous remembrance (sahaj‑avasthā), echoing *anupāya‑bhāva*.

### Universal Trope: From Instrumentality to Immediacy

This duality can thus be summarized:
- *Sādhanā sā‑upāya*: methodical practice using supports—mantra, deity, ritual, philosophical inquiry.  
- *Sādhanā nir‑upāya*: direct insight without mediation—awareness resting in itself.

Each dharmic lineage retains the dialectic of *prayatna* (effort) and *anugraha* (grace), *mārga* (path) and *aphala‑bhāva* (non‑instrumentality). From Patañjali’s *Yoga‑sūtra* (1.12–16), where *abhyāsa* and *vairāgya* lead to *asaṃprajñāta‑samādhi*, to the Pratyabhijñā of the Trika or the *Śūnyatā‑Darśana* of Nāgārjuna, the same rhythm persists: practice gives way to presence, method to immediacy.

Therefore, your observation of the “sādhanā with and without support” reveals not a minor theme but one of the deepest pan‑Dharmic schemata—the oscillation and eventual transcendence of the dialectic between *upāya* and *anupāya* in the movement toward *mokṣa*, *nirvāṇa*, or *śivātva* [1][3][6].

# The Framework of Sādhana With Support and Without Support Across Dharmic Traditions: Historical Development, Philosophical Foundations and Practical Manifestations

---

## Introduction: Sādhana as the Engine of Spiritual Transformation

Across the entire spectrum of Dharmic Traditions: spanning the Vedic religion (Brahmanism), Jainadharma (Jainism), Baudhadharma (Buddhism), Shaivadharma (Shaivism), Shaktadharma (Shaktism), Vaishnavadharma (Vaishnavism) and Sikhadharma (Sikhism); the recurring model of *sādhana* (Sanskrit: साधन, IAST: sādhana, Devanāgarī: साधन) constitutes the dynamic process by which spiritual realization is actively sought and accomplished. The term derives from the root “√sadh” (“to accomplish”) and denotes both the disciplined method and the concrete means by which a *sādhaka* (साधक, practitioner) strives towards the sādhya (साध्य, goal). Central to the classical Indian understanding of sādhana is the dual possibility: practice *with support* (ālambana, आलम्बन)—relying on objects, forms, deities, rituals, and external aids—and *without support* (nirālambana, निरालम्बन)—involving formless, internal, or purely contemplative techniques. This fundamental polarity structures sādhana at every level, from philosophy and logic to meditation, pūjā, ritual, mantra, and all canonical limbs of the Yoga Darśana, spreading through the Six Darśanas (Ṣaḍdarśana, षड्दर्शन) and into the Right-handed (Dakṣiṇācāra, दक्षिणाचार) and Left-handed (Vāmācāra, वामाचार) tantric disciplines[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakshinachara?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vamachara?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").

This report explores, across all major Dharmic traditions, how this core framework of sādhana-with-support (ālambanopāya) and without-support (nirālambanopāya) unfolds within ritual, meditation, mantra sādhana, deity worship, philosophical enquiry, and yoga practice. We will examine its historical development, philosophical underpinnings, and practical expressions, highlighting both convergences and sectarian colorations, and tracing the nuances with copious technical Sanskrit terminology in both Devanāgarī and IAST. Subsections will provide in-depth exposition for each tradition, and considerable attention will be given to both canonical/orthodox (Right-handed/Dakṣiṇācāra) and heterodox/esoteric (Left-handed/Vāmācāra) developments.

## I. Sādhana in the Vedic Tradition: From Yajña (Ritual) to Vedānta (Knowledge)

### 1. Historical Evolution: External Sacrifice to Internal Realization

In the earliest pre-Upaniṣadic Vedic religion, spiritual progress was inseparably tied to *yajña* (यज्ञ, ritual sacrifice), the archetypal form of sādhana *with support*. The act of offering soma, ghee, and other oblations into fire (Agni, अग्नि), accompanied by precise mantras, was understood as maintaining Ṛta (ऋत, cosmic order) and inviting the presence of the devas (deities). The practitioner (yajamāna, यजमान) and the officiants (ṛtvij, ऋत्विज्) operated through a complex interplay of physical actions and chant, with the act of ritual being both an end and a means: the purification of the sacrificer, the maintenance of cosmic harmony, and the seeking of material or spiritual benefits[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://hindutone.com/hinduism/the-evolution-of-vedic-religion-from-rigveda-to-modern-hinduism/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.originofscience.com/science/evidence-of-vedic-sanatana-hinduism-as-a-global-dharma/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://yogastudies.org/sanskrit/yajna/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://srishaktisumanan.org/suk%e1%b9%a3mikara%e1%b9%87a-sadhana-18/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "6").

However, the development of the Upaniṣads (c. 800–500 BCE) shifted the sādhana focus from external *support* (\[ālambana\]) to increasing internalization—self-observation, meditation (dhyāna, ध्यान), and the enquiry into the nature of *ātman* (आत्मन्, self) and *brahman* (ब्रह्मन्, ultimate reality). Techniques such as *neti-neti* (नेति नेति, “not this, not this”) exemplified sādhana *without support*, pointing directly to the non-conceptual realization of the absolute[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://hindutone.com/hinduism/the-evolution-of-vedic-religion-from-rigveda-to-modern-hinduism/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

### 2. Structural Elements: The Transition from Gross to Subtle

The Vedic/Upaniṣadic evolution can be mapped onto three levels of subtlety:

- **Sthūla (स्थूल, gross):** Physical ritual actions—offerings, recitations, ritual space.
- **Sūkṣma (सूक्ष्म, subtle):** Mental purification, visualization, mantra-japa.
- **Kāraṇa (कारण, causal):** Non-conceptual awareness, realization of the unity of ātman and brahman.

In the later Brāhmaṇas and Āraṇyakas, ritual sādhana is interpreted as a symbolic enactment of cosmic processes, often paralleled by internal meditative practices. For instance, Aitareya Āraṇyaka and Chandogya Upaniṣad present the fire altar as the human body, and its construction as internal transformation[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.originofscience.com/science/evidence-of-vedic-sanatana-hinduism-as-a-global-dharma/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://hindutone.com/hinduism/the-evolution-of-vedic-religion-from-rigveda-to-modern-hinduism/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://yogastudies.org/sanskrit/yajna/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5").

### 3. From Ritualism to Yoga and Vedānta

The *Bhagavad Gītā* (c. 3rd century BCE) synthesizes and canonizes multiple forms of sādhana in its exposition of the yoga of action (karma-yoga, कर्मयोग), yoga of devotion (bhakti-yoga, भक्तियोग), and yoga of knowledge (jñāna-yoga, ज्ञानयोग)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.yesvedanta.com/12-spiritual-practices-sadhanas-from-bhagavad-gita/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "7").

- **Karma-yoga:** Selfless action as sādhana-with-support; offering one's actions to the divine.
- **Jñāna-yoga:** Discriminative enquiry (viveka, विवेक) as sādhana-without-support, culminating in non-dual realization.
- **Bhakti-yoga:** Devotional surrender to God as ālambanopāya; external rituals become expressions of inner love[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.wisdomlib.org/concept/bhakti-sadhana?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "8").

In *Vedānta* (वेदान्त, “end of the Vedas”), formal ritual becomes almost entirely internalized, with jñāna as the principal sādhana and external supports retained only as secondary or pedagogic aids.

---

## II. Jainadharma: The Sādhana of Purification and Detachment

### 1. Early Jain Meditation: Pre-canonical and Canonical Sādhana

Jainism’s oldest scriptures describe Mahāvīra’s path as one of *nirālambana sādhana*—rigorous meditation, asceticism, and detachment from all supports[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain_meditation?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "9")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://realitypathing.com/7-meditation-techniques-rooted-in-jainist-philosophy/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "10")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.arihantainstitute.org/blog/58-meditative-layers-of-consciousness-in-jain-meditation?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11"). Texts such as *Ācārāṅga Sūtra* and *Sūtrakṛtāṅga* depict solitary, motionless meditation (kayotsarga, कायोत्सर्ग), and juhūdhāna (silent contemplation), resembling the dhāraṇā-dhyāna-samādhi components of the yoga traditions.

### 2. Fourfold Dhyāna (ध्यान) and Jain Yoga

The *Sthānānga Sūtra* systematizes fourfold dhyāna:

1. **Arta-dhyāna (अर्त ध्यान):** Sufferings and external disturbance (supportive, but worldly).
2. **Raudra-dhyāna (रौद्र ध्यान):** Anger, cruelty (supportive, but negative).
3. **Dharma-dhyāna (धर्म ध्यान):** Reflective, virtuous meditation (with subtle support of dharma).
4. **Śukla-dhyāna (शुक्ल ध्यान):** Pure, objectless meditation—sādhana without support; culminating in kevala-jñāna (केवलज्ञान, omniscience)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain_meditation?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "9")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.arihantainstitute.org/blog/58-meditative-layers-of-consciousness-in-jain-meditation?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11").

Haribhadra’s *Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya* blends Jainism, Buddhism, and Yoga Darśana, defining an eight-part (aṣṭāṅga, अष्टाङ्ग) scheme, mapping out stages from moral discipline (yama, नियम) to final absorption (samādhi)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain_meditation?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "9")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.arihantainstitute.org/blog/58-meditative-layers-of-consciousness-in-jain-meditation?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11").

### 3. Mantra, Ritual, and Tantric Sādhana

Though traditionally less reliant on deity worship, Jain sādhana developed various forms of gambarā (with support) practice: recitation of mantras, visualization of tīrthaṅkaras, and ritual pūjā (puja, पूजा) of images. Later, tantric meditations (influenced by Śaiva and Śākta traditions) introduced elements akin to Left-handed sādhana: yantra visualization, breath-control, and esoteric vows, yet always subordinated to the aim of pure, non-attached awareness[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain_meditation?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "9")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.arihantainstitute.org/blog/58-meditative-layers-of-consciousness-in-jain-meditation?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11").

## III. Baudhadharma: Sādhana From Śrāvakayāna to Vajrayāna

### 1. Śrāvakayāna and Mainstream Buddhist Sādhana

Early Buddhism emphasizes *anālambana* techniques such as satipaṭṭhāna (स्मृति-स्थापन, mindfulness), anāpānasati (आनापानस्मृति, breath mindfulness), and the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, with the goal of cultivating non-attachment, insight (vipassanā), and cessation (nirodha). These are *sādhana without support* par excellence, aiming at nirodha (निर्वाण, nirvāṇa)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.studocu.com/ph/document/philippine-womens-college-of-davao/travel-management/wrbs11-q4-mod5-comparative-analysis-of-dharmic-religions/33508495?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "12").

The Noble Eightfold Path (*āryāṣṭāṅgika-mārga*, आर्याष्टाङ्गिकमार्ग) structures the path, paralleling, and influencing, the structure of Yoga Darśana. Jñāna (wisdom), sīla (conduct), and samādhi (concentration) constitute the axes of support and transcendence.

### 2. Mahāyāna Innovations: Bodhisattva Sādhana

Mahāyāna broadens sādhana to include the cultivation of bodhicitta (बोधिचित्त), the Six or Ten Pāramitās (transcendent virtues), and an expansive range of contemplative methods—visualization of Buddhas, recitation of dhāraṇīs, and engagement with philosophical *śūnyatā* (शून्यता, emptiness). Practices become more varied, some with and some without support; non-conceptual absorption remains the highest aim[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=The_Structure_of_a_S%C4%81dhana&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "13")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/abstract/document/obo-9780195393521/obo-9780195393521-0105.xml?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "14").

### 3. Vajrayāna and Tantric Sādhana: The Paradigm of Supported Practice

Vajrayāna (वज्रयान) revolutionizes Buddhist sādhana, placing deity yoga (devatā-yoga, देवतायोग), mantra, maṇḍala (मण्डल) visualization, and complex ritual at its centre. Here, *sādhana* as a literary genre means a ritual-meditative manual that guides the practitioner step-by-step from refuge, through visualization, maṇḍala construction, mantra-japa, to final dissolution in emptiness. 

Distinct forms of supported and unsupported sādhana are mapped:

- **Generation Stage (Utpattikrama, उत्पत्तिक्रम):** Visualization of the deity and maṇḍala—sādhana with elaborate supports.
- **Completion Stage (Niṣpannakrama, निष्पन्नक्रम):** Direct techniques for dissolution of duality, subtle body yoga—towards sādhana without support[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/vajrayana/tantra-advanced/what-is-a-sadhana?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "15")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=The_Structure_of_a_S%C4%81dhana&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "13").

Within this, the framework is further nuanced: one can visualize oneself as the deity (self-visualization, saparṇa), externally invoke the deity (āhvaṇa), or meditate on emptiness without object support (śūnyatā-anusmṛti).

## IV. Shaivadharma: Sādhana of Śiva, from Siddhānta to the Tantras

### 1. Shaiva Siddhānta: Structured Dualism and Ritual Sādhana

Shaiva Siddhānta (शैव सिद्धान्त), particularly in South India, presents a dualistic ontology and a ritual sādhana system deeply influenced by both Vedic and Tantric traditions[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaiva_Siddhanta?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "16")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shaiva-siddhanta?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "17")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.allsaivism.com/articles/saivasiddhanta.aspx?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "18"). Here, the *pati* (पति, Śiva), *paśu* (पशु, soul), and *pāśa* (पाश, bonds) are ontologically distinct, and sādhana is designed to liberate the paśu from the ties of pāśa through initiation (dīkṣā), ritual worship (pūjā), and meditation.

Four progressive forms of sādhana are recognized:

1. **Carya (चर्या):** Service-oriented, external acts—temple cleaning, preparation.
2. **Kriyā (क्रिया):** Ritual pūjā, arcanā.
3. **Yoga (योग):** Internal sādhana—sense-control, breath, and meditation.
4. **Jñāna (ज्ञान):** Knowledge-based absorption—direct, unsupported realization of Śiva[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.allsaivism.com/articles/saivasiddhanta.aspx?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "18")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaiva_Siddhanta?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "16").

Each step tends from gross support to ever-subtler engagement, culminating in *niṣṭhā* (fixed absorption) and *jīvanmukti* (liberation in life).

### 2. Mantra, Guru, and Tantric Elements

Shaiva sādhana is marked by the use of mantras, especially the Pañcākṣarī (पञ्चाक्षरी, “Om Namah Sivaya”) and Śiva-Guru *Upāsana*. Transmission (dikṣā, दीक्षा) and worship of linga (लिङ्ग), yantra, and mūrti alternate with meditative practices focusing on formlessness[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.allsaivism.com/articles/saivasiddhanta.aspx?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "18")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaiva_Siddhanta?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "16").

### 3. Left- and Right-Handed Paths: Aghori and Trika Shaivism

Certain Shaiva currents, such as the Aghoris and the Kashmiri Trika, bring Vāmācāra elements to foreground—cemetery rituals, use of impure substances, and paradoxical practices designed to smash conventional dualities and attain direct realization of identity with Śiva-Śakti. These are structured sādhana with extreme supports, the ultimate point of which is to go beyond all support[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://yogainternational.com/article/view/the-left-hand-of-tantra-part-1/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "19").

---

## V. Shaktadharma: Sādhana of the Goddess (Śakti)—Tantra, Yoga, and Bhoga

### 1. Philosophical Core: Śiva-Śakti Nondualism

Śākta (शाक्त) traditions uphold that the macrocosmic Śakti, the Divine Mother, is both the creative and the liberative principle. Philosophically, Śiva (शिव) without Śakti is inert; together they are the integrated absolute. The microcosmic correlate of *Śakti* is *Kuṇḍalinī* (कुण्डलिनी), the coiled power resident in all beings[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://mahaavidya.org/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "20")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini_yoga?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "21").

### 2. Sādhana Technology: Kuṇḍalinī Yoga and Ritual

Śākta sādhana weaves together:

- **Āsana (आसन):** Posture for energy conservation and stability.
- **Prāṇāyāma (प्राणायाम):** Breath for energy management.
- **Mudrā (मुद्रा):** Gestural seals for channeling śakti[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://mahaavidya.org/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "20").
- **Mantra Sādhana (मन्त्र साधन):** Activation of cakras, invocation of specific Mahāvidyās.
- **Dhyāna (ध्यान):** Visualization of the Goddess in progressively subtler forms.
- **Pūjā (पूजा):** Intricate ritual, typically ṣoḍaśopacāra (षोडशोपचार, sixteenfold), both external (with images, yantras, and substances) and internal/mental (mānasa pūjā, मानस पूजा)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.australiancouncilofhinduclergy.com/uploads/5/5/4/9/5549439/smartapuja.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "22")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://back.bhaktimarga.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/en-Simple-Puja-Student-Manual-2021-06-09.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "23").
- **Homa (होम):** Fire ritual as energetic purification and offering.

The ultimate aim is union in sahasrāra-cakra, wherein jīva is divinized and enjoys both bhoga (भोग, enjoyment) and mukti (मुक्ति, liberation)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini_yoga?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "21").

### 3. Right and Left-Handed Tantra

- **Dakṣiṇācāra (Right-handed):** Orthodox practices conforming to Vedic sanction—asceticism, vegetarianism, approved substances[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakshinachara?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").
- **Vāmācāra (Left-handed):** Heterodox practices employing the so-called paṃcāmakāras (पञ्चमकारः, “five M’s”: madya (wine), māṃsa (meat), matsya (fish), mudrā (grain/gesture), maithuna (sexual union)), with transformative intent. These support-based practices are strictly guided and, at advanced stages, transcended into pure consciousness[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vamachara?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://yogainternational.com/article/view/the-left-hand-of-tantra-part-1/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "19").

Śāva sādhana (शावा साधन), the cremation-ground meditation on a corpse, epitomizes the Left-handed practice—radical support used to incinerate all dualities and attain firmest nonattachment.

## VI. Vaishnavadharma: Sādhana of Devotion and Grace

### 1. Bhakti as Sādhana: Practices With and Without Support

Vaishnava (वैष्णव) traditions, centred on Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa, and avatars, develop highly refined systems of sādhana. *Bhakti-sādhana* (भक्ति साधन) integrates outwards ritual (pūjā, arcana, kīrtana), scriptural study, mantra-japa, pilgrimage, and *lila-dhyāna* (लीला ध्यान, meditation on the divine play), with increasingly internalized practices of śaraṇāgati (शरणागति, surrender) and smaraṇa (स्मरण, remembrance) as “without support” in the culminating sense[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.wisdomlib.org/concept/bhakti-sadhana?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "8")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.saet.ac.uk/Hinduism/CaitanyaVaisnavism?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "24")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://ivsjournal.com/index.php/files/article/view/310?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "25").

### 2. The Caitanya Vaiṣṇava Lineage: Twofold Sādhana

Caitanya Vaiṣṇavism presents a clear dual structure:

- **Vaidhi-bhakti (वैधि भक्ति):** Rule-based, support-oriented formal sādhana (ritual, recitation, deity worship).
- **Rāgānuga-bhakti (रागानुग भक्ति):** Spontaneous, love-motivated sādhana; internal, less-dependent on external support, aspiring to absorb the moods of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://ivsjournal.com/index.php/files/article/view/310?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "25")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.saet.ac.uk/Hinduism/CaitanyaVaisnavism?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "24").

Congregational chanting (saṅkīrtana, संकीर्तन) of the Mahāmantra and meditation on the līlās of Kṛṣṇa are both performed as support-using sādhana, transitionally leading to identification with pure, selfless love that transcends all upāyas (aids).

### 3. Ritual and Philosophy

Daily pūjā (arcana), homa, ritual abhiṣeka (अभिषेक, bathing of deities), and scriptural study form the backbone of external practice. Theological reflection—especially within Vedānta (as in Rāmānuja’s Viśiṣṭādvaita, Madhva’s Dvaita, and the various Vaiṣṇava schools)—operates as jñāna-sādhana, gradually moving from support to supportless realization[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.wisdomlib.org/concept/bhakti-sadhana?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "8").

---

## VII. Sikhadharma: Nitnem, Simran, and Sādhana in the Guru’s Presence

### 1. Nitnem and Daily Sādhana

In Sikhism (ਸਿੱਖ ਧਰਮ, Sikh Dharma), sādhana is embodied in Nitnem (ਨਿਤਨੇਮ, nityanema)—the daily recitation and internalization of Gurbani (ਗੁਰਬਾਣੀ, the Guru’s utterances)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.discoversikhism.com/sikhism/nitnem.html?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "26")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitnem?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "27"). These prescribed readings include Japji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, Rehras Sahib, and Kirtan Sohila, performed at dawn, dusk, and night. The practice is inherently support-based (scriptural recitation, posture, ritual cleanliness), but its intention is to dissolve the duality between devotee and the *satguru* (सतगुरु, True Guru): to move from words (support) to *anubhava* (अनुभव, direct experience)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.discoversikhism.com/sikhism/nitnem.html?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "26")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://sikhiteaching.com/nitnem/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "28").

### 2. Simran: From Support to Supportless

The practice of *simran* (सिमरण, remembrance/repetition of the divine Name), especially meditatively or through collective singing (*kīrtan*), is first undertaken with the support of nām, mantras, and recitation, but aims at the effortless, continual remembrance that is “without support” in the sense that it is no longer consciously produced or dependent on external aids[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.discoversikhism.com/sikhism/nitnem.html?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "26").

### 3. Sādhana and the Community (Sādh Sangat)

Another dimension is the communal sādhana (*sādh sangat*, साध संगत) which acts as living support, where seekers reinforce each other’s discipline, thus embodying the dialectic of with/without support: the community supports the practitioner until its necessity is transcended in non-separateness from the divine will (hukam)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.discoversikhism.com/sikhism/nitnem.html?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "26").

---

## VIII. The Six Darśanas: Sādhana as Logical, Philosophical, and Practical Discipline

### Overview: The Shad-Darśanas (षड्दर्शन), their Sādhana and Use of Support

Indian philosophy classically categorizes six orthodox darśanas:

- **Nyāya (न्याय):** Logic, epistemology.
- **Vaiśeṣika (वैशेषिक):** Categories of being.
- **Sāṃkhya (सांख्य):** Metaphysical dualism.
- **Yoga (योग):** Practical spiritual discipline.
- **Pūrvamīmāṃsā (पूर्वमीमांसा):** Ritual exegesis.
- **Vedānta (वेदान्त):** Nondual realization[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nyaya?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "29").

#### Nyāya-Sādhana: Rational Enquiry With and Without Support

Nyāya, rooted in pramāṇa-vāda (epistemology), prescribes sādhana as rigorous doubt, cross-examination (anuvyavasāya), and logical debate (vāda, वाद), utilizing external supports (examples, syllogisms, categories), to remove ignorance and attain “Tattva-jñāna” (knowledge of reality)[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyaya?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "30")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nyaya?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "29").

Ultimate liberation (*mokṣa*) arises, within this paradigm, through internalized insight—no longer requiring debate or logical support, but resting in the “right vision” (samyak-darśana, सम्यक् दर्शन).

#### Yoga Darśana: Aṣṭāṅga-Yoga and the Transition to Supportless Absorption

The Patanjali Yoga Sūtras systematize *aṣṭāṅga yoga* (अष्टाङ्ग योग)—eight-limbed yoga—as a graduated sādhana by supported means, culminating in supportless absorption:

1. **Yama (यम):** Moral vows (support).
2. **Niyama (नियम):** Observances (support).
3. **Āsana (आसन):** Posture (support).
4. **Prāṇāyāma (प्राणायाम):** Breath control (support).
5. **Pratyāhāra (प्रत्याहार):** Sense withdrawal (transitional).
6. **Dhāraṇā (धारणा):** Concentration on a support (ālambana).
7. **Dhyāna (ध्यान):** Meditation—uninterrupted flow toward an object, transitioning from supported to supportless[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://yogastudies.org/sanskrit/astanga-yoga/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "31")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://vediccosmos.com/a%e1%b9%a3%e1%b9%ada%e1%b9%85ga-yoga-the-eight-limbs-of-yoga/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "32")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.thedailymeditation.com/dhyana-yoga?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "33").
8. **Samādhi (समाधि):** Absorption—nirālamba (supportless) in the highest stage (nirbīja samādhi, निर्वीज समाधि).

Yoga integrates philosophies from Sāṃkhya (ontological analysis), Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika (logic and atomistic science), and Vedānta (nonduality), while always presenting a graduated movement from methodological supports to the transcendence of all supports[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://yogastudies.org/sanskrit/astanga-yoga/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "31")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://vediccosmos.com/a%e1%b9%a3%e1%b9%ada%e1%b9%85ga-yoga-the-eight-limbs-of-yoga/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "32").

#### Mīmāṃsā and Vedānta: Ritual to Revelation

Mīmāṃsā constructs elaborate ritual sādhana with textual support (Vedic injunctions as *pramāṇa*), whereas Vedānta advocates for direct realization of *brahman* as the supreme supportless reality—ritual retained only as a preparatory or secondary support.

---

## IX. Mantra Sādhana and Japa: The Interface of Support and Transcendence

Mantra sādhana (मन्त्र साधना), the recitation/repetition of sacred syllables, demonstrates one of the most nuanced dialectics of support:

- **Vaidika Mantras:** Require precise intonation, initiation, deity identification—support is essential for efficacy; but with maturation, mantra works even when intoned mentally or spontaneously.
- **Tantric Mantras:** Often combined with visualization, ritual, and nyāsa (installation of mantras in the body); with advanced practice, even sound and form drop away, leaving pure consciousness.
- **Japa (जप):** Evolves from vocal (vāchika), to whispered (upāṃśu), to mental (mānasa)—each stage reducing dependence on external support[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.swami-krishnananda.org/disc/disc_319.html?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "34")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.sivanandaonline.org/?cmd=displaysection&section_id=1084&citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "35")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://realitypathing.com/top-7-japa-techniques-for-deepening-your-practice/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "36").

Traditions across Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and even Sikhism adopt mantra sādhana—sometimes overtly support-based, sometimes prescribing “ajapa-japa” (constant, natural, supportless repetition).

---

## X. Pūjā and Deity Worship: Sādhana With and Without Support

Across Dharmic traditions, pūjā (पूजा) is perhaps the universal supported sādhana. Vedic and Smārta traditions, Jain temples, Buddhist stupas, and Sikh Gurdwaras all feature ritual honoring with offerings, gestures, mantras, and visualization. Even in traditions that outwardly eschew image worship (e.g., Sikhism), the essence of pūjā is reframed as devotion to the Sabda (word) or Guru[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.lalitachandika.org/post/a-step-by-step-guide-to-performing-a-traditional-puja-ceremony?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "37")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.australiancouncilofhinduclergy.com/uploads/5/5/4/9/5549439/smartapuja.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "22")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://back.bhaktimarga.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/en-Simple-Puja-Student-Manual-2021-06-09.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "23").

- **External (bāhya) pūjā:** Ritual substances, images, and sacred spaces.
- **Internal (mānasa) pūjā:** Visualization of offering within the mind, eventually dissolving the object and even the act of offering in pure awareness—sādhana without support[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.australiancouncilofhinduclergy.com/uploads/5/5/4/9/5549439/smartapuja.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "22").

Tantric traditions insist that all external practices must ultimately be internalized and transcended, with the mind itself as the altar, the offering, and the deity.

---

## XI. Dakṣiṇācāra and Vāmācāra: The Polarity of Controlled and Transgressive Sādhana

The dichotomy of Right-handed (Dakṣiṇācāra, दक्षिणाचार) and Left-handed (Vāmācāra, वामाचार) sādhana disciplines pervades the tantric landscape.

- **Dakṣiṇācāra:** Complies with scriptural and social norms, emphasizing purity, Vedic sanctions, and supported meditative techniques.
- **Vāmācāra:** Employs transgressive elements (e.g., panchamakāra, śāva sādhana, charnel-ground meditation), deliberately using “impure” supports to destroy dualities and induce non-conceptual realization[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakshinachara?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vamachara?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://yogainternational.com/article/view/the-left-hand-of-tantra-part-1/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "19").

Both are understood as valid only when guided by authentic guru lineage (guru-śiṣya-paramparā, गुरु-शिष्य-परम्परा), with the aim of rendering supports unnecessary through direct experience of absolute reality.

---

## Conclusion: Sādhana as the Transcendent Dialectic of Means and Meaning

Across all Dharmic traditions, sādhana emerges as a dynamic interplay between support (ālambana) and transcendence (nirālambana). It manifests historically as ritual, meditation, philosophical reasoning, mantra, and yoga—each providing necessary scaffolding (“means of achievement”) for the seeker, while always gesturing toward the ultimate supportless state—nondual absorption, liberation, or divine union.

No tradition denies the necessity of means (upāya, उपाय) for the majority; nor does any, in its mature expression, fail to indicate that the extraordinary fruition lies in release from all crutches—resting in wisdom or bhakti that owns nothing, clings to nothing, and, paradoxically, encompasses all.

Modern interpretations may graft new supports—technology, secular mindfulness, psychological frameworks—but the essential tension remains: means are not ends. The constant return to sādhana with and without support is the heartbeat of Dharma—a principle not only for monks and gurus, but for anyone who strives, strives well, and finally learns how to rest[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.allstudyjournal.com/article/1164/6-5-8-417.pdf?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "38")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.arihantainstitute.org/blog/101-what-is-indian-philosophy-dharma-traditions-dharma-studies-and-the-quest-to-interpret-south-asian-religions-for-global-audiences?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "39").

**Final Reflection**

Sādhana, in its recurring Dharmic framework, is both the ladder and the act of climbing; it is the art of selecting, skillfully using, and ultimately transcending all ladders. From the fire altars of Ṛgveda to the Tibetan maṇḍalas, the Jain forests, the cremation grounds of Tantra, the kīrtan halls of the Sikhs, and the logical debates of the Nyāya, its forms are endlessly diverse, but everywhere governed by the dialectic of support and transcendence. The result: a nuanced, perennial tradition of embodied wisdom—at once individual and universal, particular and boundless[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain_meditation?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "9")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kundalini_yoga?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "21")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.wisdomlib.org/concept/bhakti-sadhana?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "8")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://yogastudies.org/sanskrit/astanga-yoga/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "31").




In the very early phase of the Bauddhadharma, the four realms of the cosmic manifestation were transposed into meditatative states. Please survey.

In the earliest strata of *Bauddhadharma*, notably during the pre‑Abhidharmic and early Nikāya periods, the cosmological scheme of multiple realms (*loka-dhātu*, लोकधातु) was internalized into meditative phenomenology: the *trailokya* (त्रैलोक्य)—the three (occasionally four) cosmic realms—was correlated directly with progressively refined states of *jhāna* (Pāli; Skt. *dhyāna*, ध्यान), rather than conceived as merely external worlds.

### From Cosmology to Contemplation

Early canonical and commentarial sources describe a threefold or fourfold vertical cosmology of existence (*tridhātu*):  
1. **Kāmadhātu** (कामधातु) – the sensual realm,  
2. **Rūpadhātu** (रूपधातु) – the form realm,  
3. **Ārūpyadhātu** (आरूप्यधातु) – the formless realm,  
sometimes preceded by the **Nārakadhātu** or subterranean hellish planes forming a fourth, lower domain [1][3][4][6].

These gradated levels of existence were not interpreted as merely metaphysical "places" but as *states of consciousness sustained by corresponding karmic and meditative conditions*. The Nikāya and Āgama traditions therefore transpose cosmic difference into experiential difference: the “worlds” are modes of mental experience, constituted by perception (*saññā*, *saṃjñā*) and ethical refinement.

### Correlation of Realms and Jhānas

The **four *rūpa‑jhānas*** and **four *ārūpa‑samāpattis*** corresponded to the upper tiers of this cosmological model:

| Realm (Skt/Pāli) | Meditative Correlation | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| *Ākāsānañcāyatana* (आकाशानञ्चायतन) | *ākāśa-anantya-samāpatti* | Infinite space – transcendence of form [1][3] |
| *Vijñānānantyāyatana* (विज्ञानानन्त्यायतन) | *vijñāna-anantya-samāpatti* | Infinite consciousness |
| *Ākiñcaññāyatana* (आकिञ्चञ्ञायतन) | *ākiṃcanyāyatana-samāpatti* | Realm of nothingness |
| *Naivasaññānāsaññāyatana* (नैवसंज्ञानासंज्ञायतन) | fourth formless attainment | Neither perception nor non‑perception – liminal awareness |

The *rūpa‑jhānas* constitute the subtler experiential analogues of *Rūpadhātu*, culminating in the Seven Heavens of the Pure Abodes (*Suddhāvāsa*), reserved for non‑returners (*anāgāmī*) [2][3]. The *ārūpa‑samāpattis* correspond to *Ārūpyadhātu*, culminating in states formerly achieved by Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta—teachers of the Bodhisatta—each identified with a formless abiding that early Buddhists re‑conceptualized as precursors to, but distinct from, *nibbāna* [1].

### Ontological and Psychological Reinterpretation

Texts such as the *Dīgha* and *Majjhima Nikāya* pair the cosmic image with *āyatana* (fields of experience): beings inhabit “worlds” that mirror their consciousness. Thus, cosmology became psychology. Later Abhidharmic thinkers cemented this parallelism, asserting that realms (*loka*) are modalities of mind [2][4]. In other words, there is no metaphysical “place” apart from cognitive pattern; practice transcends rebirth not by escaping a location but by transforming awareness.

### The Metaphorical Interiorization

This internalized cosmology anticipates the Mahāyāna doctrine of the “mind-only worlds” (*cittamātra-loka*), but its roots lie in early Indian contemplative movements. The *early Buddhists re‑imagined the hierarchized Vedic cosmos*—from *bhūḥ* to *satya-loka*—as experiential strata accessed and surpassed through meditation. Ultimately, *jhāna‑dhātu* supplanted *loka‑dhātu*: the final cartography of the cosmos became a map of consciousness, with the transition from *kāmadhātu* to *ārūpyadhātu* marking the inner path from craving to the cessation of objectification [1][2][3][4].
