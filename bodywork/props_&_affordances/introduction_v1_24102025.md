# Bodywork: Props and Affordances - An Introduction #

Throughout my exploration of many branches of the vast tree of the Dharmic Traditions, I have come to appreciate a recurring trope or framework that manifests repeatedly throughout in different guises, stated simply it is sadhana conducted with support and/or without. This is evident in different evocations and subtraditions of the Vedic Tradition, Jainadharma, Baudhadharma, Shaivadharma, Shaktadharma, Vaishnavadharma and Sikhadharma, amongst others. It is evident in meditation, puja, deity worship, philosophy, logic, mantra sadhana, ritual, all limbs of the traditional and canonical Yoga Darshana and the other traditional Six Darshanas and are evident in both Right-handed sadhana disciplines, as well as Left-handed. Please survey. Use Sanskrit technical terms in Devanagari and IAST as required.

Your observation regarding the recurring polarity of *sādhanā* (साधना / sādhana)—whether undertaken *with support* (सोपाय sā‑upāya) or *without support* (निर्उपाय nir‑upāya)—touches a profound and pan‑Indic metaphysical grammar that underlies the Dharmic traditions in their various institutional and experiential forms. Across Vedānta, Śaiva and Śākta tantra, Bauddha and Jaina praxis, and even Sikh and Nātha formulations, this structural duality persists: the tension between *upāya* (means, method, support) and *anupāya* (direct, selfless realisation).

### Meaning and Structure of Sādhanā

The term *sādhanā* (साधना) derives from the verbal root *√sādh*, meaning “to accomplish” or “to bring to completion” [1][3][6]. It refers to any disciplined method that transforms consciousness—ritual (*kriyā*), meditation (*dhyāna*), devotion (*bhakti*), action (*karma*), or knowledge (*jñāna*). The practitioner, or *sādhaka* (साधक), engages in sustained *abhyāsa* (अभ्यास, repeated disciplined practice), guided by *śraddhā* (faith), *guru‑upadeśa* (instruction), and *niyama* (restraint).

### Two Modalities of Sādhanā: With and Without Support

This polarity—*sādhanā sā‑upāya* and *sādhanā nir‑upāya*—is pervasive:

- In **Śaiva Tantra**, Abhinavagupta’s *Tantrāloka* differentiates *upāya* (व्युत्पन्नोपाय)–based practice (through mantra, visualization, ritual) from *anupāya* (अनुपाय), the spontaneous realization where no technique is operative, the state of *śāmbhavopāya* (divine awareness) transcending method.
  
- In **Bauddha Dharma**, especially in Vajrayāna, *upāya‑kauśalya* (उपाय‑कौशल्य, skilful means) is balanced by *prajñā* (wisdom). While method generates transformation, the highest realization (*anuttara‑yoga*) moves beyond even the concept of method—hence *upāya* and *anupāya* become unified in non‑dual gnosis.

- In **Vedānta**, the trajectory of *sādhana‑catuṣṭaya‑sampatti* (साधन‑चतुष्टय‑संपत्ति)—viveka, vairāgya, śamādi‑ṣaṭka‑sampatti, mumukṣutva—serves as the preparatory *upāya* leading to *ātma‑jñāna*. The final *aparokṣānubhūti* (direct knowledge) is *nir‑upāya*—self‑revealing, requiring no instrument.

- In **Śāktadharma**, the polarity manifests as *vidyā‑upāsanā* (guided invocation with supports such as mantra, yantra, deity) and *nirvikalpā‑samādhi*, the formless awareness without external medium.

- In **Jainadharma**, parallels arise between *śubha‑yoga* and *śuddha‑yoga*: the former employs disciplined supports (restraint, meditation objects), while the latter arises when even meditation’s duality dissolves, leading to *kevala‑jñāna*.

- In **Sikhī**, *simran* (स्मरण, remembrance of the nām) can begin as supported repetition (nāma‑japa) and culminate in spontaneous remembrance (sahaj‑avasthā), echoing *anupāya‑bhāva*.

### Universal Trope: From Instrumentality to Immediacy

This duality can thus be summarized:
- *Sādhanā sā‑upāya*: methodical practice using supports—mantra, deity, ritual, philosophical inquiry.  
- *Sādhanā nir‑upāya*: direct insight without mediation—awareness resting in itself.

Each dharmic lineage retains the dialectic of *prayatna* (effort) and *anugraha* (grace), *mārga* (path) and *aphala‑bhāva* (non‑instrumentality). From Patañjali’s *Yoga‑sūtra* (1.12–16), where *abhyāsa* and *vairāgya* lead to *asaṃprajñāta‑samādhi*, to the Pratyabhijñā of the Trika or the *Śūnyatā‑Darśana* of Nāgārjuna, the same rhythm persists: practice gives way to presence, method to immediacy.

Therefore, your observation of the “sādhanā with and without support” reveals not a minor theme but one of the deepest pan‑Dharmic schemata—the oscillation and eventual transcendence of the dialectic between *upāya* and *anupāya* in the movement toward *mokṣa*, *nirvāṇa*, or *śivātva* [1][3][6].

In the very early phase of the Bauddhadharma, the four realms of the cosmic manifestation were transposed into meditatative states. Please survey.

In the earliest strata of *Bauddhadharma*, notably during the pre‑Abhidharmic and early Nikāya periods, the cosmological scheme of multiple realms (*loka-dhātu*, लोकधातु) was internalized into meditative phenomenology: the *trailokya* (त्रैलोक्य)—the three (occasionally four) cosmic realms—was correlated directly with progressively refined states of *jhāna* (Pāli; Skt. *dhyāna*, ध्यान), rather than conceived as merely external worlds.

### From Cosmology to Contemplation

Early canonical and commentarial sources describe a threefold or fourfold vertical cosmology of existence (*tridhātu*):  
1. **Kāmadhātu** (कामधातु) – the sensual realm,  
2. **Rūpadhātu** (रूपधातु) – the form realm,  
3. **Ārūpyadhātu** (आरूप्यधातु) – the formless realm,  
sometimes preceded by the **Nārakadhātu** or subterranean hellish planes forming a fourth, lower domain [1][3][4][6].

These gradated levels of existence were not interpreted as merely metaphysical "places" but as *states of consciousness sustained by corresponding karmic and meditative conditions*. The Nikāya and Āgama traditions therefore transpose cosmic difference into experiential difference: the “worlds” are modes of mental experience, constituted by perception (*saññā*, *saṃjñā*) and ethical refinement.

### Correlation of Realms and Jhānas

The **four *rūpa‑jhānas*** and **four *ārūpa‑samāpattis*** corresponded to the upper tiers of this cosmological model:

| Realm (Skt/Pāli) | Meditative Correlation | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| *Ākāsānañcāyatana* (आकाशानञ्चायतन) | *ākāśa-anantya-samāpatti* | Infinite space – transcendence of form [1][3] |
| *Vijñānānantyāyatana* (विज्ञानानन्त्यायतन) | *vijñāna-anantya-samāpatti* | Infinite consciousness |
| *Ākiñcaññāyatana* (आकिञ्चञ्ञायतन) | *ākiṃcanyāyatana-samāpatti* | Realm of nothingness |
| *Naivasaññānāsaññāyatana* (नैवसंज्ञानासंज्ञायतन) | fourth formless attainment | Neither perception nor non‑perception – liminal awareness |

The *rūpa‑jhānas* constitute the subtler experiential analogues of *Rūpadhātu*, culminating in the Seven Heavens of the Pure Abodes (*Suddhāvāsa*), reserved for non‑returners (*anāgāmī*) [2][3]. The *ārūpa‑samāpattis* correspond to *Ārūpyadhātu*, culminating in states formerly achieved by Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta—teachers of the Bodhisatta—each identified with a formless abiding that early Buddhists re‑conceptualized as precursors to, but distinct from, *nibbāna* [1].

### Ontological and Psychological Reinterpretation

Texts such as the *Dīgha* and *Majjhima Nikāya* pair the cosmic image with *āyatana* (fields of experience): beings inhabit “worlds” that mirror their consciousness. Thus, cosmology became psychology. Later Abhidharmic thinkers cemented this parallelism, asserting that realms (*loka*) are modalities of mind [2][4]. In other words, there is no metaphysical “place” apart from cognitive pattern; practice transcends rebirth not by escaping a location but by transforming awareness.

### The Metaphorical Interiorization

This internalized cosmology anticipates the Mahāyāna doctrine of the “mind-only worlds” (*cittamātra-loka*), but its roots lie in early Indian contemplative movements. The *early Buddhists re‑imagined the hierarchized Vedic cosmos*—from *bhūḥ* to *satya-loka*—as experiential strata accessed and surpassed through meditation. Ultimately, *jhāna‑dhātu* supplanted *loka‑dhātu*: the final cartography of the cosmos became a map of consciousness, with the transition from *kāmadhātu* to *ārūpyadhātu* marking the inner path from craving to the cessation of objectification [1][2][3][4].
