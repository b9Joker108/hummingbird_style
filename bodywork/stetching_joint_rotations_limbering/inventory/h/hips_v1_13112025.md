# Hips: An Introduction #

The human hip joint moves in three anatomical planes—sagittal, frontal, and transverse—allowing six distinct types of motion. These are grouped into three primary ranges of motion: flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and internal/external rotation.

🦴 Overview: The Hip Joint as a Multiaxial Ball-and-Socket

- Joint type: Synovial ball-and-socket (articulatio coxae)
- Bones involved: Head of femur and acetabulum of pelvis
- Function: Supports weight-bearing and dynamic movement with high stability

1️⃣ Sagittal Plane: Flexion and Extension

| Motion     | Description                                                                 | Normal ROM (degrees) | Axis of Rotation         |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Flexion   | Thigh moves forward/up toward torso (e.g., sitting, walking)                 | 110–120°              | Transverse axis           |
| Extension | Thigh moves backward/down behind torso (e.g., standing, hip thrust)         | 10–15°                | Transverse axis           |

- Muscles involved:
  - Flexion: Iliopsoas, rectus femoris, sartorius
  - Extension: Gluteus maximus, hamstrings
- End-feel: Tissue stretch or approximation

2️⃣ Frontal Plane: Abduction and Adduction

| Motion     | Description                                                                 | Normal ROM (degrees) | Axis of Rotation         |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Abduction | Thigh moves away from midline (e.g., side leg raise)                         | 30–50°                | Anteroposterior axis      |
| Adduction | Thigh moves toward or across midline (e.g., crossing legs)                   | 25–30°                | Anteroposterior axis      |

- Muscles involved:
  - Abduction: Gluteus medius/minimus, tensor fasciae latae
  - Adduction: Adductor longus/brevis/magnus, gracilis
- End-feel: Tissue stretch or approximation

3️⃣ Transverse Plane: Internal and External Rotation

| Motion           | Description                                                                 | Normal ROM (degrees) | Axis of Rotation     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Internal Rotation | Thigh rotates inward toward midline (e.g., turning foot inward)             | 30–40°                | Vertical axis         |
| External Rotation | Thigh rotates outward away from midline (e.g., turning foot outward)        | 40–60°                | Vertical axis         |

- Muscles involved:
  - Internal: Gluteus medius/minimus (anterior fibers), tensor fasciae latae
  - External: Piriformis, obturator externus/internus, quadratus femoris
- End-feel: Tissue stretch

🔄 Compound Movements

- Circumduction: Combines all three planes—used in activities like dance or martial arts.
- Functional synergy: Most daily movements (e.g., walking, squatting) involve multiple ranges simultaneously.

Would you like a biomechanical breakdown of hip movement during ritual kneeling, martial stances, or seated meditation? I can also chart how these ranges shift with age, training, or injury.
