# Bodywork-Groundwork: An Introdction #

PURVIEW:

On the face of it, this directory subfile may seem derivative and redundant. It is not so: From my knowledges, experiences and their mutual informing and iteration, it is of inestimable value and import. This is concerned with, especially, all forms of bodywork (subsuming floorwork), without footware of any kind, tooled or otherwise, done on naturally ocurring, non-human-made, non-synthetic, non-artificial or non-human-constructed or made surfacing or flooring of any kind. It subsumes much of the discourse and modalitiesÂ of: forest bathing and grounding, for example. Particularly, their science. So, training on grass, on earth or dirt, on humus, rock, pebbles, on sand, etcetera. Water surface, swimming, water-immersion and aerials, flighted or other somesuch and related training, exercise or sporting endeavour of any kind, are not within this purview. This is not something I am doing currently, but it has been profoundly important to my manifold bodywork processes and modalities historically and will be so again. Only true barefoot training with featherfoot-fall at-pace is entertained.
