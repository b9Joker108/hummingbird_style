# Bodywork-Groundwork: An Introdction #

On the face of it, this directory subfile may seem derivative and redundant. It is not so, from my knowledges, experiences and their mutual informing and iteration. This is concerned with, especially, all forms of bodywork, without footware of any kind, done on naturally ocurring, non-human-made, synthetic, artificial or constructed surfacing or flooring. It subsumes much of the discourse and modalitiesÂ of: forest bathing and grounding, for example. So, training on grass, on earth or dirt, on humus, on sand, etcetera. Water surface, swimming, water-immersiom and aerials, flighted or other somesuch training of any kind, are not within this purview. This is not sonething I am doing currently, but it has been profoundly important to my manifold bodywork processes historically and will be so again.
