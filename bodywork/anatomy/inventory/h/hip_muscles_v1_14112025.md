# Hip Muscles #

The main hip muscles include the gluteals (maximus, medius and minimus), the iliopsoas (iliacus and psoas major), the hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus), and the adductor group (longus, brevis and magnus). These muscles are responsible for a variety of movements, such as hip flexion (bending), extension (straightening), abduction (moving away from the body), adduction (moving toward the body) and rotation.

**Primary movements and associated muscles**

* **Flexion (bending the hip):** The primary muscle is the iliopsoas (iliacus and psoas major), along with the rectus femoris and sartorius.

* **Extension (straightening the hip):** The gluteus maximus is the main muscle, with assistance from the hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus).

* **Abduction (moving the leg away from the midline):** The gluteus medius and gluteus minimus are the primary muscles, with the tensor fasciae latae and piriformis also assisting.

* **Adduction (moving the leg toward the midline):** The adductor longus, brevis and magnus muscles are the main group, along with the pectineus and gracilis.

* **Lateral Rotation (rotating the thigh outward):** The gluteus maximus, piriformis and obturators (obturator internus and externus) are the primary muscles.

* **Medial Rotation (rotating the thigh inward):** The anterior fibers of the gluteus medius and minimus, along with the tensor fasciae latae, are the primary muscles.
