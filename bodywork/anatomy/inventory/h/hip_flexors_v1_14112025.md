# Hip Flexors #

The hip flexors are a group of muscles located on the front of the hip and thigh that are responsible for bringing the knee toward the chest, a movement known as hip flexion. 

The primary hip flexor muscles are the iliopsoas group, whilst several other muscles act as secondary, or assisting, hip flexors. 

**Primary Hip Flexors**

The primary hip flexors form a powerful unit, often referred to collectively as the iliopsoas, which is considered the strongest and largest inner hip muscle. This group connects the upper body to the lower body. 

* **Iliacus:** A flat, triangular muscle located deep within the pelvis that attaches to the femur (thigh bone).
* **Psoas Major:** A long, deep muscle that originates from the lower spine (vertebrae T12-L5) and also attaches to the femur.
* **Psoas Minor:** A smaller muscle present in about 60% of people, which assists the psoas major.
