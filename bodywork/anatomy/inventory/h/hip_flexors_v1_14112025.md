# Hip Flexors #

The hip flexors are a group of muscles located on the front of the hip and thigh that are responsible for bringing the knee toward the chest, a movement known as hip flexion. 

The primary hip flexor muscles are the iliopsoas group, whilst several other muscles act as secondary, or assisting, hip flexors. 

**Primary Hip Flexors**

The primary hip flexors form a powerful unit, often referred to collectively as the iliopsoas, which is considered the strongest and largest inner hip muscle. This group connects the upper body to the lower body. 

* **Iliacus:** A flat, triangular muscle located deep within the pelvis that attaches to the femur (thigh bone).
* **Psoas Major:** A long, deep muscle that originates from the lower spine (vertebrae T12-L5) and also attaches to the femur.
* **Psoas Minor:** A smaller muscle present in about 60% of people, which assists the psoas major.

**Secondary Hip Flexors**

These muscles also contribute to hip flexion, often in conjunction with other movements like knee extension or rotation. 

* **Rectus Femoris:** One of the four quadriceps muscles, it is the only one that crosses both the hip and knee joints, making it a hip flexor and a knee extensor.
* **Sartorius:** The longest muscle in the body, it crosses both the hip and knee and assists in hip flexion, abduction and external rotation.
* **Tensor Fasciae Latae (TFL):** Located on the outer side of the hip, it contributes to hip flexion, abduction and internal rotation.
* **Pectineus:** Located in the inner thigh (groin), it primarily flexes the hip and also assists with adduction (bringing the leg toward the midline).
* **Adductor Longus/Brevis/Magnus & Gracilis:** The adductor muscle group on the inner thigh all have some capacity for hip flexion.
