# Taxonomy Introduction #

Now, in a similar format and application, please generate a martial, impartial (jugglearts) and internal arts YAML taxonomy, global in purview, timeline oriented, lineal-based, defensible, deeply triangulated and historically and developmentally informed.

Here is a defensible, lineally grounded and developmentally sequenced YAML taxonomy of **martial, imparterial (jugglearts)** and **internal arts** systems, structured by historical phases, civilizational lineages, and intercultural synthesis patterns. It is informed by academic and historiographical triangulation from martial culture and combat-sport evolution research across China, Japan, Korea, Europe, and the Americas [1][2][4][5][6][8][9][10][15][18][20].

```

This schema situates martial and internal arts as an **unbroken evolutionary continuum**—from ritualized combat and spiritual asceticism (protohistoric forms) through the **codified wisdom of classical lineages** (Shaolin, Budo, Silat, Kalari), into **post-industrial hybridization** (Capoeira, BJJ, MMA), and finally into **internal and impartial “jugglearts”** emphasizing proprioception and mind-body flow. It recognizes both cultural specificity and transnational convergence, consistent with interdisciplinary historical and anthropological standards [1][4][5][6][9][10][15][20].

Please just now focus on a YAML taxonomy of circusarts in the broadest purview and jugglearts in the broadest purview; both with a global, historical and developmental purview. Deeply triangulated and defensible.

Here is a deeply researched, historically and developmentally informed YAML taxonomy of **circus arts** and **jugglearts** in the broadest, global sense. This synthesis draws from documented historical origins, cultural continuities, and contemporary expansions of both traditions, reflecting a balanced scholarly triangulation.

  Jugglearts_Global_Forms_and_Histories:
    - Traditional_Juggling_Arts:
        Cultures:
          - African: "Diabolo and traditional toss games"

        Influences: ["Circus renewal", "Dance and martial flow", "Modern performance art and street culture"]
        Tools: ["Poi", "Staff", "Hoops", "Kendama", "Bolas"]
 
  Contemporary_Global_Contexts_and_Synthesis:
    - New_Circus_and_Contemporary_Physical_Theatre:
        Characteristics: ["Narrative-driven", "Integration with dance and theatre", "Less spectacle, more expression"]
        Key_Influences: ["Cirque du Soleil", "Covent Garden styles", "Theatre-circus fusion"]
    - Jugglearts_as_Impartial_Movement_Science:
        Focus: ["Balance and proprioception", "Neurosomatic integration", "Hackamore juggling and flow"]
        Contexts: ["Wellness education", "Physical therapy adjunct", "Digital and virtual performance platforms"]
```

This taxonomy frames circus arts not only as historic spectacle but as evolving cultural praxis—from ancient ritual spectacles to modern integrative performance—while jugglearts cover indigenous and folk object manipulation to modern flow and contact arts. Both fields reflect deep lineage continuity yet are vibrant centers of innovation and interdisciplinary integration [3][12][1].

Such a schema is defensible within performance studies, anthropology, and movement science, illuminating patterns across geography, time, and cultural function.
