# Taxonomy Introduction #

Now, in a similar format and application, please generate a martial, impartial (jugglearts) and internal arts YAML taxonomy, global in purview, timeline oriented, lineal-based, defensible, deeply triangulated and historically and developmentally informed.

Here is a defensible, lineally grounded and developmentally sequenced YAML taxonomy of **martial, imparterial (jugglearts)** and **internal arts** systems, structured by historical phases, civilizational lineages, and intercultural synthesis patterns. It is informed by academic and historiographical triangulation from martial culture and combat-sport evolution research across China, Japan, Korea, Europe, and the Americas [1][2][4][5][6][8][9][10][15][18][20].

This schema situates martial and internal arts as an **unbroken evolutionary continuum**—from ritualized combat and spiritual asceticism (protohistoric forms) through the **codified wisdom of classical lineages** (Shaolin, Budo, Silat, Kalari), into **post-industrial hybridization** (Capoeira, BJJ, MMA), and finally into **internal and impartial “jugglearts”** emphasizing proprioception and mind-body flow. It recognizes both cultural specificity and transnational convergence, consistent with interdisciplinary historical and anthropological standards [1][4][5][6][9][10][15][20].
