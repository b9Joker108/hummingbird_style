# Taxonomy Introduction #

Now, in a similar format and application, please generate a martial, impartial (jugglearts) and internal arts YAML taxonomy, global in purview, timeline oriented, lineal-based, defensible, deeply triangulated and historically and developmentally informed.

Here is a defensible, lineally grounded and developmentally sequenced YAML taxonomy of **martial, imparterial (jugglearts)** and **internal arts** systems, structured by historical phases, civilizational lineages, and intercultural synthesis patterns. It is informed by academic and historiographical triangulation from martial culture and combat-sport evolution research across China, Japan, Korea, Europe, and the Americas [1][2][4][5][6][8][9][10][15][18][20].

```

This schema situates martial and internal arts as an **unbroken evolutionary continuum**—from ritualized combat and spiritual asceticism (protohistoric forms) through the **codified wisdom of classical lineages** (Shaolin, Budo, Silat, Kalari), into **post-industrial hybridization** (Capoeira, BJJ, MMA), and finally into **internal and impartial “jugglearts”** emphasizing proprioception and mind-body flow. It recognizes both cultural specificity and transnational convergence, consistent with interdisciplinary historical and anthropological standards [1][4][5][6][9][10][15][20].

Please just now focus on a YAML taxonomy of circusarts in the broadest purview and jugglearts in the broadest purview; both with a global, historical and developmental purview. Deeply triangulated and defensible.

Here is a deeply researched, historically and developmentally informed YAML taxonomy of **circus arts** and **jugglearts** in the broadest, global sense. This synthesis draws from documented historical origins, cultural continuities, and contemporary expansions of both traditions, reflecting a balanced scholarly triangulation.

```yaml
Circus_and_Jugglearts_Taxonomy:

          Examples: ["Circus Maximus chariot spectacles", "Roman acrobatics", "Greek pankration displays"]
          Characteristics: "Large-scale public entertainment combining equestrian, acrobatics, and spectacle"
      - South_Asian_and_Indic_Traditions:
          Examples: ["Jatra and Nautanki traveling troupes", "Kalari Payattu correlated performance", "Street acrobatics and folk juggling"]
          Characteristics: "Sacralized physical storytelling with martial and musical integration"
      - East_Asian_Performance_Cultures:
          Examples: ["Chinese court acrobatics (Han–Tang epochs)", "Japanese Edo-period traveling entertainers"]

      - Asian_Terrestrial_Art_Form_Convergences:
          Examples: ["Silk Road acrobatic exchanges", "Japanese Sarugaku influences", "Indian akhada wrestling clowns"]
          Integration: "Cross-cultural blending of storytelling, display, and physical skill"
 
  Classical_Modern_Circus_Emergence (18th–20th_Century):
    - Birth_of_Modern_Circus:
        Founder: "Philip Astley, 1768 England"
        Innovations: ["Riding Rings", "Equestrian theatre", "Multidisciplinary acts under one tent"]

        Key_Companies: ["Barnum and Bailey", "Ringling Bros.", "Great Yarmouth Hippodrome"]
  
  Jugglearts_Global_Forms_and_Histories:
    - Traditional_Juggling_Arts:
        Cultures:
          - African: "Diabolo and traditional toss games"
          - Asian: "Chinese plate spinning, Japanese devil sticks"
          - European: "Club juggling, balls, and rings"
        Historical_Legacy: "Ceremonial, entertainment, and skill demonstration with deep cultural roots"
    - Jugglearts_in_Contemporary_Culture:
        Innovations: ["Contact juggling", "Flow arts", "Object manipulation hybridization"]
        Influences: ["Circus renewal", "Dance and martial flow", "Modern performance art and street culture"]
        Tools: ["Poi", "Staff", "Hoops", "Kendama", "Bolas"]
 
  Contemporary_Global_Contexts_and_Synthesis:
    - New_Circus_and_Contemporary_Physical_Theatre:
        Characteristics: ["Narrative-driven", "Integration with dance and theatre", "Less spectacle, more expression"]
        Key_Influences: ["Cirque du Soleil", "Covent Garden styles", "Theatre-circus fusion"]

        Focus: ["Balance and proprioception", "Neurosomatic integration", "Hackamore juggling and flow"]
        Contexts: ["Wellness education", "Physical therapy adjunct", "Digital and virtual performance platforms"]
```

This taxonomy frames circus arts not only as historic spectacle but as evolving cultural praxis—from ancient ritual spectacles to modern integrative performance—while jugglearts cover indigenous and folk object manipulation to modern flow and contact arts. Both fields reflect deep lineage continuity yet are vibrant centers of innovation and interdisciplinary integration [3][12][1].

Such a schema is defensible within performance studies, anthropology, and movement science, illuminating patterns across geography, time, and cultural function.

You totally failed to include all Islander and Archipelago traditions

Here is an expanded, historically and culturally triangulated YAML addition focused explicitly on the **Islander and Archipelago "little" traditions** within circus and jugglearts. This highlights the rich diversity and specific practices across the Pacific Islands, Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia, and adjacent archipelagos, acknowledging their distinct cultural roles, performance contexts, and historical lineage:

Indonesia and the Phillipines?

Included below is a focused, historically and culturally triangulated YAML addition detailing traditional and folk circus and jugglearts from Indonesia and the Philippines within broader Islander and Archipelago forms. These emphasize their unique influences, ritual uses, and stylistic particularities:
