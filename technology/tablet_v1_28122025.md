The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra supports Qi wireless charging (up to 15W fast wireless charging) as a built-in hardware feature—software updates like recent One UI versions (including 7.0/7.1) don't remove this capability, but bugs or reset toggles post-update can make it seem broken. If it's not working after your upgrade, here's a direct troubleshooting guide to get it running:

### Basic Checks First
- **Compatible charger**: Use a Qi-certified wireless charger that supports at least 10-15W output (e.g., Samsung's official Wireless Charger Pad or Trio). Cheap or old ones might not trigger fast charging.
- **Placement and alignment**: Center the tablet on the pad (the coil is near the middle of the back). Avoid thick cases (>3mm) or metallic/credit card interference—remove them during charging.
- **Overheating or battery level**: If the device is hot or battery is very low/high, charging may pause. Let it cool and try again.
- **Test the hardware**: Plug in via USB-C to rule out a broader charging port issue. If wired works but wireless doesn't, focus on the steps below.

### Enable/Toggle Fast Wireless Charging in Settings
Post-update, this toggle sometimes gets disabled or glitchy—flipping it can reset the feature:
1. Open **Settings** > **Battery**.
2. Tap **Charging settings** (or **More battery settings** if that's the label in your One UI version).
3. Ensure **Fast wireless charging** is toggled **ON**. If it's already on, toggle it off, wait 10 seconds, then back on.
4. Place the tablet on the charger to test—look for a charging icon or notification confirming wireless charging has started (it may say "Fast wireless charging" if compatible).

If the option isn't visible, restart your tablet or check for a software update (Settings > Software update > Download and install) to patch any bugs.

### Advanced Fixes If Still Not Working
- **Clear cache partition** (won't delete data): Power off the tablet. Hold Volume Up + Power until the Samsung logo appears, then release. Use volume keys to navigate to "Wipe cache partition," select with Power, confirm, then reboot.
- **Reset network/charging settings**: Go to Settings > General management > Reset > Reset settings (this resets Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile data but may fix charging glitches without losing files).
- **Safe mode test**: Restart in safe mode (hold Power button > long-press "Power off" > tap Safe mode). If wireless charging works here, a third-party app is interfering—uninstall recent ones.
- **Known One UI 7 bugs**: Some users report charging hiccups after this update (though more common on phones like S23/S24 Ultra).<grok:render card_id="6f30c7" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">

</grok:render> If toggling doesn't fix it, it could be a temporary software glitch—wait for a patch or contact Samsung support via their app/site for a potential rollback or repair.

If none of this works, describe the exact symptoms (e.g., no charging at all, slow only, error message) for more targeted help. This should get you charging wirelessly again without much hassle.
