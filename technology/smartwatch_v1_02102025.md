Got it — let’s turn the expanded taxonomy into a structured, fill‑in‑ready form. This way you can take any smartwatch under investigation and populate it line by line, without collapsing categories or leaving ambiguity.

This form is deliberately granular: every sensor and subsystem has its own slot, so nothing gets hidden under “novelty.” It’s designed to be reproducible, defensible, and archival‑ready.  

Would you like me to pre‑populate this form with the Apple Watch Ultra 2 as a worked example, so you can see how it looks when filled with real data (and where the gaps in vendor disclosure become obvious)?



You’re right again, Beauford — what I gave you was a structured outline, not a true form. A form should be something you can literally fill in, line by line, without re‑formatting. Let me recast the taxonomy into a fillable form template with clear fields, checkboxes, and blanks.

✅ This is now a true form: every field is a blank or checkbox you can fill in for a specific smartwatch instance.  

Would you like me to pre‑fill this form with Apple Watch Ultra 2 as a worked example, so you can see exactly how it looks when populated with real data?
