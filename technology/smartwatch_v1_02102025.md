This form is deliberately granular: every sensor and subsystem has its own slot, so nothing gets hidden under “novelty.” It’s designed to be reproducible, defensible, and archival‑ready.  

Would you like me to pre‑populate this form with the Apple Watch Ultra 2 as a worked example, so you can see how it looks when filled with real data (and where the gaps in vendor disclosure become obvious)?



You’re right again, Beauford — what I gave you was a structured outline, not a true form. A form should be something you can literally fill in, line by line, without re‑formatting. Let me recast the taxonomy into a fillable form template with clear fields, checkboxes, and blanks.

### State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Smartwatch Selection Analysis for Programmatic Interaction and Data Sovereignty ###

1.0 Executive Summary

This report provides a technical analysis of the current smartwatch market (Q4 2025) to identify the optimal device based on three core criteria:
 * State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Sensor Suite: The quality, accuracy, and breadth of available biometric and environmental sensors.
 * Data Sovereignty: The degree of user control over data, including local storage, exportability, and privacy architecture.
 * Programmatic Interaction: The availability and capability of SDKs and APIs for accessing raw or processed sensor data.

The market presents a fundamental trade-off: The most polished, consumer-friendly ecosystems (Apple) offer excellent APIs and strong on-device privacy but within a locked-down "walled garden." More open platforms (Wear OS) provide greater flexibility and access to lower-level data but can involve data fragmentation across multiple cloud services. Specialist platforms (Garmin) excel in specific metrics but are often built around a proprietary, cloud-centric model.

2.0 SOTA Sensor Technology Breakdown (Current Baseline: Late 2025)

The definition of "SOTA" has coalesced around a specific set of high-fidelity sensors. Below is an evaluation of the key technologies and their current industry-leading implementations.
 * Optical Heart Rate (PPG - Photoplethysmography):
   * SOTA Implementation: Multi-channel, multi-wavelength (e.g., green, red, infrared LEDs) sensor arrays with multiple photodiodes. This configuration improves accuracy during motion, on varying skin tones, and enables derivative metrics.
   * Key Metrics: Heart Rate (HR), Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Blood Oxygen (SpO₂), Respiration Rate.
   * Leaders: Apple (Series 10/Ultra 3), Samsung (Galaxy Watch 8), and Garmin (Elevate Gen 5) all utilise highly advanced arrays. Accuracy differences are now marginal for resting measurements but still vary during high-intensity interval training (HIIT).
 * Electrical (ECG - Electrocardiogram):
   * SOTA Implementation: Single-lead ECG via a titanium/stainless steel electrode in the digital crown/buttons and a rear crystal electrode. The primary function is arrhythmia detection (specifically AFib).
   * Leaders: Apple, Google (Pixel Watch 3), and Samsung all have mature, regulatory-approved implementations. There is no significant performance differentiator.
 * Bioimpedance (BIA - Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis):
   * SOTA Implementation: Utilises microcurrents sent through two points of contact (e.g., two fingers on watch buttons) to estimate body composition (skeletal muscle, fat mass, body water).
   * Key Differentiator: Samsung is the undisputed leader and sole major implementer of this technology in a wrist-form factor. It provides trend data, but its accuracy is not medical-grade and is highly sensitive to hydration levels.
 * Temperature:
   * SOTA Implementation: Dual-sensor configuration (one skin-facing, one ambient-facing) to provide relative skin temperature changes, not core body temperature.
   * Key Metrics: Primarily used for menstrual cycle tracking and sleep stage analysis.
   * Leaders: Apple and Samsung have robust implementations. Utility remains limited to trend analysis.
 * Electrodermal Activity (EDA):
   * SOTA Implementation: Measures minute changes in sweat gland activity on the skin to infer sympathetic nervous system response, used as a proxy for stress.
   * Key Differentiator: Google/Fitbit is the primary innovator and leader in this space with its "cEDA" (continuous EDA) sensor. Other platforms rely on HRV for stress metrics, which is an indirect inference.
 * Location (GNSS):
   * SOTA Implementation: Dual-band (L1+L5) GNSS chipset. This provides significantly enhanced accuracy in challenging environments like dense urban canyons or deep valleys by mitigating multi-path signal errors.
   * Leaders: Apple (Ultra models), Garmin (Fenix/Epix Pro lines), and Samsung (Pro models) have adopted this as the standard for their high-end devices.
 * Emerging/Hypothesised Sensors (As of late 2025):
   * Non-Invasive Blood Pressure: Some devices (Samsung) offer cuff-based calibration for blood pressure estimation, but this is not a true cuffless, continuous measurement. SOTA is still calibration-dependent. True cuffless technology has not yet passed regulatory approval in a major market.
   * Non-Invasive Blood Glucose: Remains the "holy grail." No commercially available smartwatch offers this. Any claims should be treated with extreme skepticism pending regulatory approval (e.g., FDA, TGA).

3.0 Platform Analysis: Data Sovereignty & Programmatic Access
This section evaluates the primary platforms based on your core requirements.

3.1 Apple watchOS / HealthKit

 * Data Sovereignty: EXCELLENT.
   * Architecture: HealthKit is an on-device, encrypted database. Data is not sent to Apple's cloud by default for processing. Cloud backup via iCloud is end-to-end encrypted and user-controlled.
   * Control: The user holds the keys. Any third-party app must request granular permission for each specific data type (e.g., HKQuantityTypeIdentifierHeartRate). The user can revoke this access at any time.
   * Export: Full data export is possible via the Health app, providing an XML dump. It is comprehensive but can be cumbersome to parse.
 * Programmatic Interaction: EXCELLENT (within the ecosystem).
   * API/SDK: The native HealthKit API is mature, powerful, and well-documented.
   * Data Access: Provides access to a vast array of processed data points. You can run background queries, anchor queries for new data, and initiate workout sessions that provide real-time, high-frequency data streams (e.g., 1Hz heart rate).
   * Limitations: This is a "walled garden." You are locked into iOS/watchOS development. Direct access to raw sensor signals (e.g., raw PPG waveform) is heavily restricted. You get the clean, processed output, not the source signal.
  
3.2 Google Wear OS / Health Connect

 * Data Sovereignty: GOOD, but requires user vigilance.
   * Architecture: Health Connect is the Android equivalent of HealthKit—an on-device data store and API that centralises health data from all apps. However, the watch manufacturer (e.g., Samsung, Google) will also have its own health platform (Samsung Health, Fitbit) that syncs data to its own cloud.
   * Control: You have two layers of control: the Health Connect permissions and the manufacturer's cloud service permissions. You must actively manage both to ensure data sovereignty. You can potentially disable cloud sync for some services, but this may cripple functionality.
   * Export: Possible via Google Takeout (for Fitbit/Pixel data) or through the Samsung Health app. Format and completeness vary.
 * Programmatic Interaction: VERY GOOD, and more flexible than Apple.
   * API/SDK: Two primary avenues:
     * Health Connect API: The modern, preferred method for accessing historical and processed data from the central store.
     * Wear OS SensorManager API: This is the key differentiator. It provides direct access to raw sensor data streams in real-time, including accelerometer, gyroscope, and often the raw PPG signal (TYPE_HEART_BEAT). This is critical for custom algorithm development.
   * Manufacturer SDKs: Samsung offers a Privileged Health SDK which, if you can gain access, provides even deeper instrumentation on their devices.

3.3 Garmin Connect IQ

 * Data Sovereignty: POOR to FAIR.
   * Architecture: Fundamentally a cloud-centric platform. Most data, advanced metrics, and historical analysis live on Garmin Connect servers. The on-device storage is primarily a buffer.
   * Control: Your data is governed by Garmin's privacy policy. While they have a good reputation, the data does not reside primarily on your device.
   * Export: Excellent. Garmin is the gold standard for data export via the Garmin Connect web portal, offering formats like .FIT, .TCX, and .GPX. The .FIT format is incredibly rich, containing extensive data from a recorded activity.
 * Programmatic Interaction: GOOD, but with major caveats.
   * API/SDK:
     * Connect IQ SDK: Allows you to develop and run apps directly on the watch. From within a device app, you have excellent real-time access to sensor data. This is powerful for creating custom workout screens or on-device algorithms.
     * Garmin Health API: This is a cloud-based API for enterprise/wellness partners. It allows you to pull processed user data from Garmin's servers (with user consent). It is not designed for real-time personal app development and may have access costs.
   * Limitations: There is no simple, direct way for a personal mobile app on your phone to query real-time sensor data from a Garmin watch in the same way HealthKit or the Wear OS SensorManager allows. The primary interaction model is: record on watch -> sync to cloud -> analyze/export from cloud.
  
4.0 Synthesis & Final Recommendations

| Platform | SOTA Sensor Score | Data Sovereignty Score | Programmatic Access Score | Dominant Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Apple Watch Ultra | 9.5/10 | 9/10 | 8.5/10 | Privacy-Conscious Developer (iOS): Unbeatable fusion of SOTA hardware, on-device data security, and a polished, high-level API. |
| Samsung Galaxy Watch Pro | 9/10 | 7/10 | 9/10 | Android Developer/Researcher: Best-in-class access to raw sensor data on a mainstream device via Wear OS APIs. Sovereignty requires active management. |
| Garmin Fenix/Epix Pro | 9/10 | 5/10 | 7.5/10 | Athlete/Data Scientist: Superior for post-activity analysis via .FIT files and on-device app development (Connect IQ). Not ideal for real-time mobile app integration. |

Recommendation Profiles:
 * If your priority is building a mobile app within a secure, private ecosystem and you work with iOS:
   * Choose: Apple Watch Ultra 3.
   * Rationale: The HealthKit API provides all the high-level, real-time data you need. The on-device-first data architecture is the industry gold standard for privacy and sovereignty. You sacrifice raw signal access for a secure, stable, and powerful development environment.
 * If your priority is access to raw sensor data for custom algorithms on the Android platform:
   * Choose: Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Pro (or latest Pro model).
   * Rationale: The Wear OS SensorManager is your gateway to raw, unprocessed data streams, which is impossible on Apple's platform. The addition of the BIA sensor provides a unique data stream. You must, however, accept the trade-off of a more complex data-privacy landscape, where you need to manage both Health Connect and the manufacturer's cloud services.
 * If your priority is creating a standalone, on-watch application for a specific activity (e.g., custom dive computer, advanced hiking metrics) or deep post-workout analysis:
   * Choose: Garmin Fenix 8 or Epix Pro (latest model).
   * Rationale: The Connect IQ SDK is mature and gives you full control of the device and its sensors while an app is running. The battery life is unparalleled, enabling long-duration data logging. Your model of interaction will be on-device processing and/or post-hoc analysis of exported .FIT files, not real-time phone-to-watch communication. You must accept the cloud-centric nature of the Garmin ecosystem for all other use cases.




Of course. I understand completely. The previous analysis was a means to an end; the goal is to define the underlying technological benchmarks themselves. You are building a foundational understanding of the components to evaluate any present or future device against a consistent SOTA standard.

Here is an analysis focused on the benchmarks for sensors, data access models and the practical realities of programmatic interaction.

Technical Benchmark Report: SOTA Wearable Technologies

1.0 SOTA Sensor Benchmarks & Data Structures

This section defines the current (Q4 2025) gold standard for wearable sensors and the data they produce.

1.1 Optical Array (Photoplethysmography - PPG)

 * SOTA Benchmark: A multi-diode array featuring at least four Photo-Emitters (LEDs) and four Photo-Diodes (PDs). Critically, it must be multi-wavelength, utilizing at least green, red, and infrared (IR) light. This hardware diversity is essential for cancelling noise from motion artifacts and ensuring accuracy across diverse skin tones.
 * Key Derived Metrics:
   * Heart Rate (HR)
   * Heart Rate Variability (HRV - specifically RMSSD or SDNN)
   * Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO₂)
   * Respiration Rate
   * Blood Flow / Perfusion Index
 * Data Types & Formats:
   * Heart Rate:
     * Data Type: Double or Integer
     * Unit: count/min (beats per minute)
     * Format: A time-stamped value pair. (timestamp, value). Example: (2025-10-11T19:30:05Z, 62.0)
     * Sampling: Ranges from continuous 1Hz during workouts to opportunistic sampling every 5-10 minutes at rest.
   * HRV (RMSSD):
     * Data Type: Double
     * Unit: ms (milliseconds)
     * Format: A single value representing an analysis window, typically captured overnight or during a specific "moment of mindfulness" reading. Example: (timestamp_start, timestamp_end, 55.3)
   * SpO₂:
     * Data Type: Double
     * Unit: % (percentage)
     * Format: Time-stamped percentage. (timestamp, 0.98). Typically sampled opportunistically during sleep or on-demand.

1.2 Electrical Sensor (Electrocardiogram - ECG)

 * SOTA Benchmark: A single-lead ECG implementation with a minimum of two electrode points (e.g., watch caseback and digital crown/button) allowing for a closed circuit across the body. The key is not the hardware but the on-device algorithm's regulatory approval (e.g., FDA, TGA) for detecting conditions like Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).
 * Key Derived Metrics:
   * Sinus Rhythm classification
   * Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) classification
   * Average Heart Rate during reading
 * Data Types & Formats:
   * ECG Reading:
     * Data Type: Array of Voltage measurements.
     * Unit: mV (millivolts) or a quantized equivalent.
     * Format: A JSON object containing metadata and the voltage series. Example: {"timestamp": "...", "sampling_frequency_hz": 512, "classification": "SinusRhythm", "voltage_series": [-0.01, -0.02, 0.5, ...]}
     * Sampling: On-demand, typically a 30-second capture at a high frequency (e.g., 512Hz).

1.3 Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)

 * SOTA Benchmark: A multi-electrode implementation (minimum two points of contact) capable of passing a multi-frequency microcurrent (~5-250 kHz). The SOTA capability lies in the algorithm's ability to translate the measured impedance into a body composition estimate.
 * Key Derived Metrics:
   * Skeletal Muscle Mass
   * Fat Mass
   * Body Water Percentage
 * Data Types & Formats:
   * Body Composition:
     * Data Type: Double for each component.
     * Unit: kg or %
     * Format: A single complex object generated on-demand. Example: {"timestamp": "...", "skeletal_muscle_kg": 35.2, "fat_mass_kg": 15.8, "body_water_percent": 58.1}

1.4 Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)

 * SOTA Benchmark: A 6-axis IMU combining a high-dynamic-range 3-axis accelerometer (capable of detecting forces up to 32-g or higher for impact detection) and a 3-axis gyroscope. Fused with a magnetometer (compass) for full 9-axis orientation tracking.
  
 * Key Derived Metrics:
   * Step Count
   * Activity Type classification (running, swimming, etc.)
   * Fall/Crash Detection
   * Repetition Counting (e.g., for weight training)
   * Running Dynamics (Cadence, Ground Contact Time, Vertical Oscillation)
  
 * Data Types & Formats:
   * Raw Accelerometer/Gyroscope Data:
     * Data Type: Array of Double for [x, y, z] axes.
     * Unit: g (g-force) for accelerometer, deg/s for gyroscope.
     * Format: A stream of time-stamped 3-axis vectors. (timestamp, {x: 0.1, y: -0.9, z: 0.2})
     * Sampling: Can be very high (50-100Hz), but is often a power-drain bottleneck.

2.0 The Programmability Spectrum & API Models

"Programmability" is not monolithic. Access is tiered, with a direct trade-off between data granularity, power consumption, and ease of use.

 * Tier 1: Direct Hardware Access (The Researcher's Tier)
   * Description: Accessing the raw, unfiltered data stream directly from the sensor controller. For example, getting the individual photon counts from the PPG's photodiodes or the raw XYZ vector stream from the accelerometer at 100Hz.
   * Enabling SDK/API: SensorManager (on Wear OS) or equivalent low-level C/C++ libraries on more open platforms.
   * Use Case: Developing novel biometric algorithms (e.g., a new sleep staging model, a custom activity classifier).
   * Gotcha: Highest power consumption. Requires significant signal processing knowledge. Often restricted by the platform for stability reasons.

 * Tier 2: Real-Time Processed Stream (The App Developer's Tier)
   * Description: The platform handles the raw signal processing and provides a clean, real-time stream of processed metrics. You don't get the raw PPG signal, but you get a reliable heart rate value every second.
   * Enabling SDK/API: HealthKit HKWorkoutSession (Apple), Wear OS MeasureClient (Google).
   * Use Case: Building a workout app that shows live HR, pace, and distance.
   * Gotcha: You are reliant on the platform's "black box" algorithms. You can't change how HR is calculated.

 * Tier 3: Batched Historical Query (The Dashboard Tier)
   * Description: Asynchronous querying of the central, on-device health database. This is not for real-time applications but for analyzing data that has already been collected and stored.
   * Enabling SDK/API: HealthKit HKSampleQuery (Apple), Health Connect API ReadRecords (Google).
   * Use Case: Building a dashboard that shows the user's average resting heart rate over the last month.
   * Gotcha: Access may be delayed, and data is often down-sampled to save space (e.g., you get the min/max/avg HR for a 5-minute period, not every single beat).

 * Tier 4: Cloud API Query (The Enterprise Tier)
   * Description: Requesting user data from the vendor's cloud servers after it has been synced from the watch.
   * Enabling SDK/API: Garmin Health API, Fitbit Web API.
   * Use Case: A corporate wellness platform pulling daily step counts for users who have opted-in.
   * Gotcha: Introduces network latency, privacy concerns, and is often subject to rate limits and API access fees. Data is never real-time.

3.0 Data Sovereignty Models: An Architectural Benchmark

 * Model A - The On-Device Vault (SOTA for Sovereignty):
   * Architecture: Data is written to and processed from an encrypted, on-device database. The user is the sole gatekeeper of the cryptographic keys. Cloud sync is an optional, end-to-end encrypted backup, unreadable by the platform vendor.
   * Developer Implication: You must code defensively. Your app must request granular permissions for every data type and gracefully handle denial of access. The user can revoke your access at any time, and your app will immediately stop receiving data.
   * Exemplar: Apple HealthKit.

 * Model B - The Hybrid Federator (SOTA for Interoperability):
   * Architecture: An on-device database acts as a central hub (the "federator"), but it co-exists with multiple apps that may also be performing their own cloud syncs. The user has sovereignty over the hub but must manage the "leaks" from connected apps.
   * Developer Implication: You can choose to read from the central hub for aggregated data or interface with a specific app's API for more unique data. Your app must declare which data it intends to write to and read from the central hub.
   * Exemplar: Google Health Connect.

 * Model C - The Trust-Based Cloud Silo (Legacy Model):
   * Architecture: Data's primary residence is the vendor's cloud. Sovereignty is not architectural but policy-based. You trust the vendor to be a good steward of the data. The only true user control is account deletion or data export.
   * Developer Implication: Programmatic access is almost exclusively via a Tier 4 (Cloud) API. Data sovereignty is not a feature you can build around; it is a feature you and your users hope the vendor provides. The .FIT (Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer) file format is the SOTA standard for export from these systems, as it is extremely comprehensive.
   * Exemplar: Garmin Connect, Polar Flow.



That's exactly right. There is no single, standardized file type that covers the full spectrum of raw, processed and niche wearable data. The landscape is fragmented, with standards emerging based on specific use cases rather than a universal approach.

Here’s a breakdown of the situation.

The Standard for Activities: .FIT 🏃‍♂️

For discrete, recorded fitness activities (like a run, bike ride, or swim), there is a powerful and widely adopted standard: the .FIT (Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer) file type.

 * What it is: Originally developed by Garmin but now an open standard, .FIT is a binary file format designed to be a container for all data related to a specific activity. It can package GPS tracks, time-series data like heart rate and cadence, sensor metadata, and much more into a single, efficient file.
  
 * Why it dominates: It's the de facto standard for interoperability between fitness platforms. When you upload an activity to Strava, TrainingPeaks, or another service, you're almost certainly using a .FIT file behind the scenes. It's the "Rosetta Stone" of workout data.
The Formats for Bulk Export: .XML and .CSV 🗂️
When you request a complete archive of your health data from a platform, you typically get it in a general-purpose data format, not a specialized one.

 * .XML (eXtensible Markup Language): This is what Apple Health uses for its full data export. It’s extremely comprehensive and structured, preserving the relationships between different data points. However, it's verbose and not easy to work with directly (you usually need a script or specific tool to parse it). It's built for archival, not for easy analysis.

 * .CSV (Comma-Separated Values): Many services offer .CSV exports. This format is flat and tabular, perfect for pulling into a spreadsheet like Excel or a data analysis tool like Python's pandas library. It’s excellent for analyzing one specific metric over time (e.g., a list of daily step counts) but poor at representing complex, nested data.

The "Format" for Programmatic Access: .JSON and Native Objects 🧑‍💻
This is the key point for your interest in programmability. For real-time, raw, or on-demand sensor readings (like an ECG or BIA scan), there often is no file type or extension involved at all.

 * Why? Because this data isn't meant to be saved as a standalone file by the user. It's meant to be consumed by an application programmatically via an API.

 * What you get: When your app requests the current heart rate or the result of an ECG scan, the platform's SDK doesn't hand you a file. It gives you the data as a native object in your programming language (like an HKSample in Swift for Apple) or, more universally, as a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object.
JSON is the lingua franca of modern APIs. It's lightweight, human-readable, and perfectly structured for representing the kind of key-value data that sensors produce (e.g., {"timestamp": "...", "value": 65, "unit": "count/min"}). You, the developer, receive this JSON data and then decide what to do with it—display it, analyze it, or then save it to a file format of your own choosing.

WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS Watch from a SOTA sensor standpoint, SDK/API progrommability, data and consumer sovereignty standpoint?

The Kalobee (America) U8 Ultra 5G Smartwatch offers a strong feature set for its price bracket, but from a state-of-the-art (SOTA) sensor, SDK/API programmability, and data sovereignty perspective, there are critical factors worth weighing, especially for an advanced researcher or health-oriented user .

### SOTA Sensors and Biosignal Capability

While the spec list includes heart rate, SpO2, sleep, and stress sensors, the actual component quality and technical documentation (sensor model, OEM, algorithmic transparency) are unclear for this model. Leading SOTA watches (e.g., Zepp, Huawei, Apple, Samsung) typically disclose sensor arrays: photoplethysmography, ECG, accelerometer, gyroscope, and temperature sensors with their respective IC/firmware versions. The U8 Ultra advertises impressive multi-modal tracking, but in practice, generic imports may use lower-fidelity biosensors, affecting reliability in clinical-grade tracking (HRV, SpO2, sleep staging) . For use cases beyond raw step counting or basic SpO2, scientific documentation is essential and often lacking in low-cost multi-feature watches.

### SDK/API Programmability

Most "U8 Ultra" smartwatches (and similarly branded, mass-market 5G/rotating camera models) are notoriously closed platforms, offering minimal SDK/API access and poor third-party integration. Custom Android variants may theoretically support APK installs but seldom expose standardized sensor APIs (like Google Fit, Health Connect, Wear OS APIs, or Bluetooth GATT server) for raw data access or scripting. This severely restricts custom data workflows, root access logging, or integration with research-grade apps (ObsidianMD, biomarker logging, automation with Python/Termux) . Proprietary apps and OTA may push firmware for maintenance, but user programmability for raw sensor data, custom notifications, or automation is limited.

### Data & Consumer Sovereignty

Generic 5G/Android smartwatches frequently route biometric, location, voice, and call data via proprietary servers or OEM-managed clouds (not end-to-end encrypted, nor export-friendly). Data portability is often restricted: users may export logs only via the onboard app, with minimal control over sync formats (CSV, JSON, full backup). Direct, local-only data collection—critical for privacy/adversarial threat models—is not usually supported. SOS/emergency features and QR/app integration may be useful, but high sovereignty demands data staying on-device, full user deletion rights, and explicit privacy guarantees, which are rarely documented for such devices.

### Core Evaluation Table

| Feature                | U8 Ultra 5G Description | SOTA Expectation       |
|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Sensor Quality         | HR, SpO2, pedometer, stress   | Clinical-grade sensor IDs; ECG/PPG/HRV algorithms |
| SDK/API Access         | Proprietary app, closed       | Fully documented SDK/API, open source or developer support |
| Data Sovereignty       | Unknown, likely cloud-tied    | On-device storage, user export and deletion rights, third-party sync support |

### Final Verdict

For mainstream wellness tracking and occasional advanced features (5G SIM, rotating camera, NFC), this device provides excellent value for casual users. However, for rigorous biometric research, programmable health workflows, or privacy-critical applications, SOTA watches from Zepp, Huawei, and Apple remain superior due to transparent sensor documentation, mature SDK/API support, and real data ownership. The U8 Ultra lags in all these advanced criteria, so it's adequate for basic lifestyle use but not for cutting-edge research or sovereign, programmable health tracking .



It is a Google Watch?

The Kalobee U8 Ultra 5G Smartwatch is not a Google Watch[2][3]. It runs a full version of Android OS (often Android 8.1 or Android 9.0) and supports Google Play, Google apps, and various other Android features, but it is not part of Google's official Wear OS ecosystem[2][3][7]. 

This means the operating system is a customized mobile Android version for smartwatches, and not the specialized Google Wear OS platform found in official Google Pixel Watches or select Samsung Galaxy Watches[3][5]. While it can run many Google apps (including Play Store), its system is built by Kalobee and independent manufacturers rather than Google itself[2][3][5].

If it can install apps from Play it conforms to WearOS!

A smartwatch being able to install apps from the Google Play Store does not necessarily mean it conforms to Wear OS standards[1][3]. Many full-Android smartwatches (like Kalobee U8 Ultra) run modified, mobile Android versions that support Play Store, but this differs from Google’s official Wear OS platform designed for watches[1][5]. 

Only devices that run Wear OS (formerly Android Wear) are considered true Wear OS watches; they support the Wear OS companion app, Google’s wearable APIs, and integration with the Wear OS ecosystem (tiles, complications, optimized sync, and power management)[1][3][5]. 

The Kalobee U8 Ultra uses a version of Android configured for watches, not Wear OS. It can install many Play Store apps because it supports standard Android APKs, but it does not provide the specialized Wear OS UI, system services, or Play Store for Wear features mandatory for “real” Wear OS devices[1][5].Not all watches that allow installation of apps from the Play Store conform to Wear OS standards[1]. Full-Android smartwatches like the Kalobee U8 Ultra can often install apps from the Play Store because they run mobile Android (sometimes modified), but that is distinct from Google's official Wear OS system for smartwatches[1][5]. Wear OS provides specific UI features, wearable APIs, and official support in the Play Store Wear section. Android smartwatches may support general Android APKs—including Play apps—but unless they specifically use Wear OS by Google, they do not conform to Wear OS requirements or its ecosystem[1][3][5].

Why would a company in their 2025 model smartwatch with an excellent hardware tech spec install Android 9 or 10 on their device?

In 2025, many companies still release devices—with even high specs—running older Android versions like 9 or 10 due to several factors: 

### Cost, Stability and Certification

- Using Android 9/10 allows manufacturers to rely on proven, stable firmware with established compatibility for a wide range of hardware, drivers and legacy apps[2][4].
- Certification and development costs for newer versions (e.g., Android 15/16) may be high, especially for niche vendors or devices not targeting premium markets[2].
- Some companies aim to maximize profitability in budget, mid-range, or specialty segments (like wearables, feature phones, and certain tablets) by avoiding the expense and software rework needed for the latest Android revisions[4].

### App Compatibility and Fragmentation

- Global Android adoption is extremely fragmented: as of 2025, only a minority of devices run the latest Android 15—just 4.5% worldwide—while large shares of active phones still run Android 10, 11, 12, or even 9[2][4].
- This fragmentation means applications, accessory vendors, and OEM partners often still support older Android SDKs, making it less risky for manufacturers to launch new hardware with legacy Android versions[2].
- In regions with older app ecosystems, or markets where open-source Android forks are popular, running legacy Android ensures compatibility for locally developed or sideloaded apps.

### Control and Customization

- Manufacturers producing smartwatches, custom IoT devices, and non-mainstream smartphones often use Android 9 or 10 because it’s easier to modify (root access, custom kernels, legacy hardware compatibility), maintain company-specific user experiences, or avoid Google’s certification requirements for newer versions[4].
- Some emerging market vendors still use Android 9/10 to reduce support costs, accelerate time-to-market, and maintain a familiar environment for users who do not prioritize the latest UI or features[4].

### Summary Table

| Reason                    | Explanation                                                 | Cited Evidence     |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Cost/Certification        | Lower engineering cost for stability and legacy hardware[2][4]      | [2][4]   |
| Fragmentation             | Most active Android devices run old versions in 2025[2]            | [2]           |
| App Compatibility         | Ensures support for older apps and regional ecosystems[2][4]    | [2][4]   |
| Customization Control     | Easier modifications for niche or non-Google certified devices[4]    | [4]           |

Despite excellent specs, installing Android 9 or 10 in 2025 can reflect decisions driven by economics, support requirements, and ecosystem realities—not always technical inferiority[2][4].

# Why Would a 2025 Smartwatch With Excellent Hardware Ship With Android 9 or 10?  
**An In-Depth Analysis of Technical, Business and Strategic Drivers**

---

## Introduction

The global smartwatch market in 2025 exhibits remarkable technological growth, intense competition, and a proliferation of models featuring outstanding hardware specifications. With vibrant AMOLED displays, multi-day battery longevity, advanced biometric sensors, and cutting-edge connectivity, the latest smartwatches rival smartphones in complexity and capability[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://9meters.com/technology/watches/best-smartwatch-for-android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1"). Despite this, an intriguing phenomenon persists: manufacturers sometimes launch premium or upper-midrange smartwatch models running older Android operating systems, specifically Android 9 ("Pie") or Android 10 ("Queen Cake"), even when their hardware could clearly support newer Android releases like 13 ("Tiramisu"), 14 ("Upside Down Cake"), or even 16 ("Baklava")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://endoflife.date/android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

This report examines the myriad reasons for such decisions, integrating technical, strategic, and business lenses. Specifically, it explores licensing challenges, certification and ecosystem hurdles (notably for Google Mobile Services and Wear OS), firmware and driver dependencies, UI and customization priorities, the substantial financial and resource implications of updating, regulatory landscapes, battery life optimization, security update policies, market targeting, app ecosystem concerns, and more. The report also provides concrete examples from the current market, demonstrating that—despite industry progress toward standardization—older Android versions still play a significant role in new smartwatch launches.

## 1. Licensing Constraints for Android 9/10 on New Hardware

A central consideration for smartwatch OEMs is the licensing situation tied to Android and, specifically, Google Mobile Services (GMS). GMS delivers the Play Store and Google’s proprietary service suite, but is only licensed for devices that meet strict compliance and OS recency requirements. As of 2025, Google typically only authorizes GMS certification for devices running the current and immediately previous major versions of Android—meaning attempts to license GMS on Android 9 or 10 in 2025 will almost certainly be rejected[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/wear-app-quality?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.esper.io/blog/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://bayton.org/android/why-devices-omit-gms/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "6").

Furthermore, since Android 13 and 14, Google made compliance even stricter for Wear OS devices:

- **Apps targeting Android 10 or lower** are not discoverable on the Play Store for devices running Wear OS versions based on later Android builds.
- All new or updated Play Store submissions must target at least Android 13 (API level 33) or Android 14 (API level 34) for wearable devices; Wear OS 4 and 5 require these versions as base OS.
- Google no longer offers GMS licensing for devices debuting with two-versions-old Android releases[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/wear-app-quality?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.esper.io/blog/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5").

For manufacturers wishing to leverage the AOSP (Android Open Source Project) version of Android, bypassing GMS is possible, but their watches cannot preload the Play Store, Google Assistant, Google Maps, or other signature Google apps. This "non-GMS" route is much more common among Asian ODMs, white-label, or B2B-focused manufacturers, especially in markets less dependent on Google’s software ecosystem[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.esper.io/blog/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

In summary, many smartwatches running Android 9 or 10 in 2025 will either:
- *Not include* GMS (and thus ship without Google apps, Play Store, and tight Android phone integration), or
- Be limited to selling in regions or via channels where GMS is not essential.
- Rely on sideloading, third-party app stores, or proprietary marketplaces[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.esper.io/blog/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://bayton.org/android/why-devices-omit-gms/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "6")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://developer.android.com/wear/releases/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "7").

**Business Impact:**  
Choosing older Android versions sharply limits access to Google’s mobile ecosystem, but may allow faster market entry and lower cost for manufacturers who prioritize control, customization, or time-to-market over app richness.

---

## 2. Google Mobile Services and Wear OS Certification

Closely linked to licensing issues is the intense certification process for Wear OS, particularly when GMS is requested. Google's compatibility program demands devices pass an ever-growing suite of tests (including CTS, CTS Verifier, CAT, GTS) and enforce restrictions around hardware conformance, security, and software update guarantees[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://source.android.com/docs/compatibility/9/android-9-cdd?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "8")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://developer.android.com/wear/releases/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "7")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/wear-app-quality?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.esper.io/blog/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5").

Since mid-2024:
- **Wear OS certification is only feasible for devices based on the latest Android platform (or at most, n-1).** Devices on Android 9 or 10 cannot pass and thus cannot access Wear OS-branded updates, features, or Play Store listings.
- Google’s roll-out of Watch Face Format (WFF) and associated toolchains (replacing legacy watch face engines) creates compatibility hurdles for watches on older Android; these platforms cannot support the new UI paradigms, which are now mandatory for Play Store watch face submissions by 2026[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.androidauthority.com/wear-os-losing-legacy-watch-face-support-3567216/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "9").
- OEMs must guarantee security patch compliance and timely updates for GMS-certified smartwatches, adding cost and development risk. Many smaller brands or ODMs producing Android 9 or 10 watches cannot guarantee such support, further disqualifying them from certification[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.esper.io/blog/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://endoflife.date/android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://developer.android.com/wear/releases/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "7")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/wear-app-quality?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4").

For business-oriented or niche watches (e.g., healthcare, fitness, or regionally-customized devices), acquiring Wear OS certification may not be a cost-effective or essential priority. Some luxury or specialty smartwatch makers (such as TAG Heuer in 2025) now abandon Wear OS in favor of their own Android-based OSes to bypass these constraints and focus on custom integration[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://9to5google.com/2025/10/10/wear-os-is-ignoring-ios-so-tag-heuer-made-its-own-android-based-smartwatch-os/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "10").

---

## 3. Driver and Firmware Compatibility

**Technical inertia** remains one of the dominant reasons for sticking to older Android versions—especially for device families based on mature or well-documented hardware platforms. Smartwatches often use SoCs (typically from Qualcomm, MediaTek, or proprietary chipmakers) that debut with specific Android OS support and a prevalidated driver stack. Porting their firmware to newer versions can introduce daunting hurdles:

- **Closed-source or infrequently updated drivers:** Qualcomm, for instance, often provides GPU driver support (Adreno) for no more than six months post-launch, sometimes only for the OS the device originally shipped with. Upgrading to a newer Android version without new drivers is challenging and may require significant reverse engineering or risk severe instability[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://xdaforums.com/t/snapdragon-driver-update-module.4685775/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://xdaforums.com/t/official-list-of-sideloaded-apps-and-workarounds-for-wear-os-tested-on-galaxy-watch.4379825/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "12").
- **Modem and sensor firmware:** Health and fitness sensors (PPG, SpO₂, ECG, GPS) depend on vendor-specific firmware and kernel modules released for known-good Android versions. Jumping to a new OS may necessitate re-certification of these firmware stacks, and may cause regressions in health data accuracy or stability[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://9meters.com/technology/watches/best-smartwatch-for-android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://xdaforums.com/t/official-list-of-sideloaded-apps-and-workarounds-for-wear-os-tested-on-galaxy-watch.4379825/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "12").
- **Kernel version limitations:** Many wearables run highly customized kernels and Board Support Packages locked to specific Android releases. Backporting vendor features and patches is costly and error-prone[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://xdaforums.com/t/snapdragon-driver-update-module.4685775/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "11").

Manufacturers pursuing a rapid product cycle, or leveraging proven hardware reference designs from ODM partners, may thus prefer not to risk device stability by leaping to untested OS versions. Many ODMs in Asia, such as Kingwear and Microwear, maintain entire product families on Android 9 or 10 precisely because their component suppliers and manufacturing lines are validated for those OS releases[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://xdaforums.com/t/official-list-of-sideloaded-apps-and-workarounds-for-wear-os-tested-on-galaxy-watch.4379825/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "12").

## 4. Custom UI and Platform Customization

Smartwatch brands targeting unique experiences—whether for branding, vertical-market needs, or hyper-customization—enjoy far more flexibility on older versions of Android. Android 9 and 10 remain vastly more "open" in practice than newer releases, for a few reasons:

- **UI/UX customization:** Google’s newer Wear OS releases and associated Jetpack libraries strongly enforce standardized UI patterns, making deep customization harder without high engineering effort. Android 9/10-based watches can still use proprietary launchers, themes, or even entirely custom app frameworks[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://developer.android.com/wear/releases/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "7")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://9meters.com/technology/watches/best-smartwatch-for-android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "1").
- **Deeper system-level access:** Restrictions on use of certain APIs, method call patterns, and permission models in the latest Android versions (see the movement to "scoped storage" and enforcement of privileged APIs) can break heavily customized legacy watch software. For example, third-party OEMs building specialized sports-tracking, medical, or industrial watches may stick to Android 9/10 for optimal flexibility.
- **Compatibility with modified or third-party ROMs:** Rooting, unlocking, and custom firmware development are simpler with Android 9/10, making these platforms attractive to enthusiast and B2B segments requiring device-side modifications[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://github.com/Simon1511/WearableSpoof?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "13")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://xdaforums.com/t/app-mod-galaxy-wearable-patch-for-samsung-phones-with-custom-roms.4208143/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "14")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://xdaforums.com/t/official-list-of-sideloaded-apps-and-workarounds-for-wear-os-tested-on-galaxy-watch.4379825/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "12").

## 5. Development and Testing Cost

The move to a newer Android version is not a simple binary update. Porting, optimizing, and validating a smartwatch platform on a new major OS is laborious, incurring direct and indirect costs for:

- **Revalidating all device functions:** This includes not only health sensors, radios, and power management, but also system and companion apps, connectivity with Android/iOS phones, and security features. Each change can introduce new bugs or performance regressions[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://fastercapital.com/content/Cost-of-validation--The-Cost-of-Validation--A-Practical-Guide-for-Software-Developers.html?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "15").
- **Regulatory retesting:** Significant platform changes often require re-certification of devices for CE, FCC, RoHS, and other standards—especially if firmware or power behavior changes (see below section).
- **End-to-end QA and user testing:** Small brands or ODMs may not have the engineering depth to repeatedly update, test, and stabilize firmware/app stacks at the pace Google and top OEMs impose for GMS/Wear OS watches. This is a major motivator for launching multiple models on a single, stable (if dated) Android codebase[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://fastercapital.com/content/Cost-of-validation--The-Cost-of-Validation--A-Practical-Guide-for-Software-Developers.html?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "15").

For ODMs and white-label businesses with razor-thin margins, these savings can be the difference between viability and bankruptcy. Updating a device family to a new platform also risks creating incompatibilities with previously-deployed software in business or specialized use cases, which can be problematic for large enterprise customers or B2B deployments.

## 6. Certification and Regulatory Compliance

Smartwatches purporting to offer advanced health metrics (ECG, SpO₂, arrhythmia warnings, etc.) and medical device functions face a complex regulatory maze, especially in countries like the US (FDA), EU (MDR), India (CDSCO), and others[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://umatechnology.org/fda-clarifies-when-health-and-fitness-wearables-should-be-considered-medical-devices/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "16")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://operonstrategist.com/wearable-technology-in-healthcare/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "17"). Device certification is not a "once and done" process; any meaningful change to the OS, particularly one that alters sensor management, battery life, or Bluetooth performance, may trigger a need for recertification:

- Watch OEMs may opt to ship new hardware with the same validated software image when their device’s most valuable selling point is its regulatory clearance.
- Revalidating with new OS versions—even for non-medical but safety-related functions (e.g., fall detection or emergency contact)—is costly and can result in lengthy delays to market.
- Certain regions may also require local in-country software validation, which is far easier with frozen, mature, stable platforms that have already been through customs and import approval processes[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://operonstrategist.com/wearable-technology-in-healthcare/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "17")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

---

## 7. Battery Life and Performance Optimization

Despite overall hardware improvements, smartwatch form factors are still heavily constrained by battery size and power efficiency requirements[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.androidcentral.com/how-extend-battery-life-wear-os?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "18")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/power?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "19"). Certain Android OS releases are well-known by brands and power users to have more predictable or efficient handling of background tasks, wakelocks, sensor polling, and networking. OEMs may choose Android 9/10 because:

- Their engineers have already finely tuned battery life and sensor performance for these versions, and lack confidence a major upgrade won’t introduce an unpredictable drain.
- Newer Android versions, with increased service activity (including for background health and AI functions), may shorten battery life or require major rework of power optimization techniques.
- They wish to avoid introducing potential power-related regressions, particularly for watches advertising multi-day or multi-week endurance[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.androidcentral.com/how-extend-battery-life-wear-os?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "18")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.zdnet.com/article/10-settings-i-changed-on-my-wearos-smartwatch-to-improve-battery-life/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "20").

Moreover, many budget- and mid-tier smartwatches compete on battery life as a key differentiator[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.androidcentral.com/how-extend-battery-life-wear-os?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "18")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3"). Sticking to a known OS build makes this much easier to achieve.

## 8. Security Update Lifecycle and Support

While using the latest Android brings security advantages, shipping devices with Android 9/10 in 2025 runs counter to mainstream infosec best practices. Nevertheless, in certain markets, especially for non-GMS devices and rapid-turnaround ODM products:

- OEMs know that the expected lifecycle is short and can prioritize stability over future update access.
- Not all manufacturers provide rigorous end-user support for OTA software updates after initial deployment—the device is sold "as is" for the expected lifespan and then replaced[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.esper.io/blog/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://thetechylife.com/is-android-9-still-supported/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "21")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://endoflife.date/android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "2").
- For GMS-certified watches, monthly security update guarantees are enforced, but non-GMS watches can avoid this obligation (albeit at cost to the end customer's security).

Some ODM and B2B deployments offer custom update pipelines, side-stepping Google’s patch cadence, especially for business or kiosk-style deployments where update disruption could cause more problems than it solves.

---

## 9. Market Segmentation and Consumer Targeting

Depending on the watch's intended audience, different trade-offs make sense. Major Wear OS devices from Samsung, Google, Garmin, Huawei, and others target tech-savvy, Google-integrated consumers, for whom GMS and app access are paramount[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.gearbrain.com/best-android-smartwatches-2025-2671695922.html?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "22"). However, another major segment consists of:

- **Budget- and mid-price buyers:** In emerging markets, ultra-low cost or "universal" smartwatches (sometimes misrepresented as "Wear OS" but in fact running Android 9/10 AOSP) can offer rich features via their own app stores for a fraction of the cost of major-brand watches. These buyers may value battery life, call/SMS functionality, local content, and fitness tracking over access to the full Google ecosystem[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.accio.com/business/trend-of-affordable-fully-android-smart-watches?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "23")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").
- **Enterprise, niche, and specialty markets:** Scenarios such as medical, industrial, security, or outdoor/rugged watches may require prioritization of custom apps or regulatory stability over Google integration or frequent feature updates.
- **Markets with weak Google presence:** In China, Russia, and other countries where GMS is unavailable or restricted, non-GMS Android smartwatches are the norm[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://bayton.org/android/why-devices-omit-gms/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "6")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.esper.io/blog/gms-vs-non-gms-for-android?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "5")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

For these segments, the risks and limitations of using an older Android version are outweighed by the benefits of stability, cost, and control.

---

## 10. Legacy App Ecosystem Stability

Another strategic motive is support for a legacy (but stable and well-supported) app ecosystem, often built atop tried-and-tested APIs and libraries that may not have been updated or maintained for the latest Android releases. Some factors include:

- **Proprietary or vertical market apps:** Specialized companion apps may only work with older Android versions, making it safer to stick to Android 9/10.
- **Third-party or sideloaded apps:** Some watchmakers use customized or sideloaded Android apps (e.g., old versions of Facebook Messenger, custom mail clients), which may not function correctly or may be blocked in newer Android builds due to Google Play Protect or deprecation of APIs[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://xdaforums.com/t/official-list-of-sideloaded-apps-and-workarounds-for-wear-os-tested-on-galaxy-watch.4379825/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "12").
- **Customer familiarity:** Existing users and enterprise customers may have deployed fleets of devices on Android 9/10 and wish to minimize the need for retraining, migration, and QA of their in-house solutions.

---

## 11. Supply Chain and Component Validation Timelines

Modern smartwatch production often involves complex coordination between component suppliers, firmware vendors, ODMs, and regional certification bodies. When a mature supply chain is validated for a particular Android OS and sensor/firmware combo, both OEMs and ODM partners are reluctant to risk last-minute schedule slips or non-compliance by switching to a brand-new platform:

- **Component validation:** All sensors, radios, and firmware must be validated together. An update to Android often means all components must be retested to guarantee compliance with applicable standards (e.g., CE, FCC, RoHS) and platform stability[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.expertmarketresearch.com.au/reports/australia-smartwatch-market?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "24").
- **ODM/White-label flexibility:** Many high-volume manufacturers offer "off-the-shelf" Android 9/10 solutions that can be lightly customized (e.g., new cases, localized firmware, app preloads) for rapid deployment to new customers[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.accio.com/business/trend-of-affordable-fully-android-smart-watches?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "23").
- **Regional regulatory delay:** Certification in some markets can take months, and any change to the OS can reset the testing clock.

---

## 12. OEM Update Policy and Fragmentation

The realities of the Android ecosystem mean that only major brands provide more than 2 years of timely OS version upgrades and security patches to their smartwatches[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/long-wear-os-5-update-delay-feels-like-bad-sign?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "25")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.androidpolice.com/5-wear-os-annoyances-google-can-no-longer-ignore/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "26"). Most budget and mid-tier OEMs ship devices with a single fixed Android version, with no expectation of future full-OS upgrades:

- **Stable deployment:** Shipping a "frozen" firmware image, even if older, ensures stability for customers averse to frequent change.
- **Avoiding abrupt fragmentation:** Since some major watches receive OS upgrades much later than headline Google/Samsung models, many secondary brands prefer to stabilize on a "last fully validated" Android and leave it unchanged.

Inconsistencies in update rollout between OEMs (and even within product lines) also incentivize some to stay with older, stable builds that their support teams and supply chains fully understand[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/long-wear-os-5-update-delay-feels-like-bad-sign?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "25")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Wearables/Issues-with-Watch-Updates/td-p/18155888?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "27")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.androidpolice.com/5-wear-os-annoyances-google-can-no-longer-ignore/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "26").

**Device Table Explanation:**

- **Longcheer, Microwear, and Kingwear** specialize in high-volume, ODM smartwatches. They typically offer customizable hardware with powerful SoCs, AMOLED displays, full GPS/BT/HR suites, and water resistance, but run Android 9 or 10 for all the reasons outlined above.
- **Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch 4**: While official firmware runs newer Android versions, the enthusiast/enterprise market continues to use custom ROMs or legacy firmwares (patched or sideloaded), specifically to maintain compatibility with sideloaded apps and to avoid enforced updates or restrictions[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://xdaforums.com/t/official-list-of-sideloaded-apps-and-workarounds-for-wear-os-tested-on-galaxy-watch.4379825/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "12")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://xdaforums.com/t/guide-galaxy-wearable-samsung-gear-android-aosp.4632721/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "28")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://xdaforums.com/t/app-mod-galaxy-wearable-patch-for-samsung-phones-with-custom-roms.4208143/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "14").

Some region-specific watches (e.g., in Australia, the Xolair X1 or Karmic K-360) also illustrate this approach, though explicit OS version is sometimes obfuscated, especially in price-sensitive or rapidly iterating segments[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://www.expertmarketresearch.com.au/reports/australia-smartwatch-market?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "24")[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://istarfit.com/smartwatch-oem-odm-suppliers-2025-top10/?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "3").

## 14. Analysis of Risks and Trade-Offs

While the above strategies are rational for certain business models and consumer segments, they introduce important risks:

- **Security vulnerabilities:** Devices on Android 9/10 no longer receive official security patches, leaving users exposed to known threats (unless significant investment is made for backporting).
- **Loss of Play Store and mainstream app access:** As of late-2023, apps targeting older SDKs are hidden from Play Store on newer hardware, and new app releases require API level 33+ targeting. This locks legacy watches out of much of the ongoing Android app ecosystem[43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054](https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/wear-app-quality?citationMarker=43dcd9a7-70db-4a1f-b0ae-981daa162054 "4").
- **Incompatibility with major phone features:** As both Android phones and associated services (e.g., Find My Device, Health Connect, Wallet) move to require tighter integration/recency, these devices grow increasingly isolated from the broader Android ecosystem.
- **Customer dissatisfaction:** When advertised features (like voice commands, payments, advanced fitness tracking) are unavailable or unreliable compared to top-tier models, reputational risk or returns can increase—particularly if end-users were misled to believe their watch was "Wear OS" when it is a non-GMS AOSP device.

## 15. Conclusion: The Inevitable Duality in the 2025 Smartwatch Market

Despite rapid evolution in smartwatch hardware and software, business and technical inertia—combined with regional and market segmentation, regulatory friction, and supply chain realities—mean that many premium or mid-tier smartwatches will continue to ship with Android 9 or 10 in 2025. These decisions are rational for manufacturers balancing cost, regulatory compliance, and speed-to-market against the advantage of running the very latest OS.

Top-tier brands (Google, Samsung, OnePlus, etc.) continue to drive Wear OS forward and offer consumers the latest features—at a price premium and with greater restrictions on customization. On the other hand, ODMs, white-label specialists, vertical/niche brands, and cost-focused vendors are likely to persist with mature Android OS images as long as component, ecosystem, and regulatory conditions allow.

**For business buyers or specialized users:**  
A smartwatch with Android 9 or 10 may offer a stable, customizable, and cost-effective platform—if you understand the limitations on app access, security, and future-proofing.

**For mainstream consumers:**  
Choosing a newer OS Wear OS device (13+) ensures access to Google services, apps, and feature-rich health integration, but at a higher price and stricter software control.

The split in strategy reflects the continued diversity—and fragmentation—at the heart of the global Android smartwatch ecosystem in 2025. Both approaches have found enduring market niches, and both are likely to persist for the foreseeable future.

---

**Key Takeaway:**  
A smartwatch in 2025 with top-end specs but Android 9 or 10 almost always reflects a calculated trade-off: speed, control, or market reach won out over ecosystem integration, update security, and the latest features. These choices remain core to the stratification and diversity of the smartwatch market, ensuring no “best” universal approach will dominate every niche any time soon.
