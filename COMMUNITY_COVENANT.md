# Community Covenant: Cultural Charter and Contribution Policy

## Preamble: The Mysterium Magnum of Collective Endeavor

This **Community Covenant** serves as the cultural constitution of the **hummingbird_style** repository. It binds all contributors—human practitioners, AI agents, editors, illustrators, researchers, and all other stakeholders—to shared principles that honor sovereignty, diversity, ethical conduct, and the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom within the domains of bodywork, integrated mystical cultivation, and allied disciplines.

We recognize that knowledge transmission is a sacred act requiring transparency, mutual respect, and accountability across the entire 360-degree purview of this repository's lifecycle: from ideation and authorship through publication, usage, and archival stewardship.

This document subsumes and extends:
- The repository's [Statement of Disclaimer](./DISCLAIMER.md)
- [Versioning and Quality Control](./VERSIONING_&_QUALITY_CONTROL.md) standards
- The [GNU General Public License v3](./LICENSE)
- Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) commitments
- Standards for human and AI-agent collaboration

## V. Human-AI Collaboration Framework

### 5.1 Philosophy of Human-AI Symbiosis

This repository embraces AI agents as:
- **Research assistants**: Aggregating information, identifying patterns, suggesting connections
- **Editorial support**: Grammar checking, consistency verification, formatting
- **Knowledge synthesizers**: Integrating diverse sources into coherent summaries
- **Accessibility enhancers**: Generating alt-text, simplifying language, creating multi-format content

AI agents are **not** replacements for human judgment, cultural sensitivity, or experiential wisdom. They are collaborators whose contributions require human verification and contextual integration.

### 5.2 Standards for AI Agent Contributions

**Transparency Requirements**
- All AI-generated or AI-assisted content must be disclosed
- Specific tools/models used should be documented (e.g., "GPT-4 assisted research compilation")
- Human oversight and verification must be explicit in Quality_Control frontmatter

**Appropriate AI Use Cases**
- Literature synthesis and citation aggregation
- Multilingual translation with human cultural review
- Accessibility adaptations (simplified language, alt-text generation)
- Structural formatting and consistency checking
- Hypothesis generation for human evaluation

**Prohibited AI Applications**
- Autonomous assertion of medical, psychological, or spiritual advice
- Unverified cultural or traditional knowledge claims
- Attribution or academic credit for AI-generated work without human authorship disclosure
- Substitution of AI output for primary source engagement

**Quality Control for AI Contributions**
- AI-assisted content must undergo the same peer review as human contributions
- Human reviewers must verify factual accuracy and cultural appropriateness
- AI limitations and potential biases must be acknowledged

### 5.3 Ethical AI Governance

**Bias Awareness**
- Recognition that AI training data reflects historical biases
- Active monitoring for erasure of marginalized knowledge systems
- Human correction of stereotypical or discriminatory AI outputs

**Data Sovereignty**
- Contributor personal information is not fed to AI systems without consent
- Traditional knowledge from closed systems is not processed by AI tools
- Privacy protections for sensitive health or personal practice information

**Environmental Consideration**
- Mindful use of computationally expensive AI tools
- Preference for efficient models and targeted rather than exhaustive AI deployment

**Continuous Evaluation**
- Regular review of AI tool effectiveness and ethical implications
- Adaptation of standards as AI capabilities and risks evolve
- Community input on AI governance policies
