**I need a way to get passage from Melbourne to Canberra with maximal airline weight from terrestrial Melboymurne to Canberra, from where I will fly?**

**Fly from Canberra after ground transport from Melbourne that allows maximum luggage weight (no strict limits), as direct flights from Melbourne impose checked baggage caps of 23kg standard per bag.**

This maximizes your airline weight by shifting the flight leg to Canberra Airport (CBR), where airlines like Qantas and Virgin Australia serve domestic routes with the same generous allowances—up to 23-32kg per checked bag depending on fare/class, and excess fees apply only beyond that (e.g., AUD $65 overweight 23-32kg on Virgin domestic).[1][2][3][4]

**Ground Transport Options (Melbourne → Canberra)**

Greyhound bus is optimal for heavy loads—no weight limits, cheap, direct, ~8 hours.[1]

| Option | Duration | Cost (AUD) | Luggage Policy | Notes |
|--------|----------|------------|----------------|-------|
| Greyhound Bus | 8h | $60–140 | Unlimited weight/size (practical limit ~30-40kg/person; declare oversized) | Departs Southern Cross Coach Terminal; arrives Canberra Jolimont Centre. Best for max load.[1] |
| Train + Bus (V/Line to Albury + Bus) | 7h 57m | $21–179 | Unlimited (train/bus agnostic) | Train Southern Cross → Albury (~3.5h), then bus (~4h). Flexible for gear.[1][5] |
| Drive (Rental/Personal Car) | 6h 56m | $83–119 (fuel/tolls) | Unlimited | ~650km Hume Hwy. Rent van/SUV for bulk (e.g., Europcar ~$100/day).[1] |

**Airline from Canberra (Max Weight Setup)**

Once in Canberra, fly domestically (e.g., CBR → MEL/SYD/BNE/ADL) with full checked allowance—no ground leg penalty.[6][7]

- **Qantas Domestic**: Economy 1-2 pieces up to 23-32kg total (weight concept); Business 2x32kg. Excess: $60/piece over 23kg; $150 extra piece. Max 32kg/bag.[3][8][9]
- **Virgin Australia Domestic**: Economy Lite 0kg (add-on), Choice/Flex 23kg; Business 2x32kg. Overweight $65/piece (23-32kg). Pre-buy excess online cheaper.[2][4]
- **Buy Excess in Advance**: Up to 40kg total possible (e.g., Jetstar add-ons, but not direct MEL-CBR); no bag >32kg safety rule.[10][11]

**Total**: Bus heavy gear to CBR (~$100 + 8h), then fly with 40kg+ checked (e.g., Virgin Business 64kg allowance).[1][2]

This beats direct MEL-CBR flight (1h10m airtime, but capped at 23kg standard).[7] Book Greyhound at greyhound.com.au; check fares for your dates (Feb 2026 peak possible). Drive if you prefer control over bulk.
