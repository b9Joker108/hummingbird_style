**I need a way to get passage from Melbourne to Canberra with maximal airline weight from terrestrial Melboymurne to Canberra, from where I will fly?**

**Fly from Canberra after ground transport from Melbourne that allows maximum luggage weight (no strict limits), as direct flights from Melbourne impose checked baggage caps of 23kg standard per bag.**

This maximizes your airline weight by shifting the flight leg to Canberra Airport (CBR), where airlines like Qantas and Virgin Australia serve domestic routes with the same generous allowances—up to 23-32kg per checked bag depending on fare/class, and excess fees apply only beyond that (e.g., AUD $65 overweight 23-32kg on Virgin domestic).[1][2][3][4]

**Ground Transport Options (Melbourne → Canberra)**

Greyhound bus is optimal for heavy loads—no weight limits, cheap, direct, ~8 hours.[1]

| Option | Duration | Cost (AUD) | Luggage Policy | Notes |
|--------|----------|------------|----------------|-------|
| Greyhound Bus | 8h | $60–140 | Unlimited weight/size (practical limit ~30-40kg/person; declare oversized) | Departs Southern Cross Coach Terminal; arrives Canberra Jolimont Centre. Best for max load.[1] |
| Train + Bus (V/Line to Albury + Bus) | 7h 57m | $21–179 | Unlimited (train/bus agnostic) | Train Southern Cross → Albury (~3.5h), then bus (~4h). Flexible for gear.[1][5] |
| Drive (Rental/Personal Car) | 6h 56m | $83–119 (fuel/tolls) | Unlimited | ~650km Hume Hwy. Rent van/SUV for bulk (e.g., Europcar ~$100/day).[1] |

**Airline from Canberra (Max Weight Setup)**

Once in Canberra, fly domestically (e.g., CBR → MEL/SYD/BNE/ADL) with full checked allowance—no ground leg penalty.[6][7]

- **Qantas Domestic**: Economy 1-2 pieces up to 23-32kg total (weight concept); Business 2x32kg. Excess: $60/piece over 23kg; $150 extra piece. Max 32kg/bag.[3][8][9]
- **Virgin Australia Domestic**: Economy Lite 0kg (add-on), Choice/Flex 23kg; Business 2x32kg. Overweight $65/piece (23-32kg). Pre-buy excess online cheaper.[2][4]
- **Buy Excess in Advance**: Up to 40kg total possible (e.g., Jetstar add-ons, but not direct MEL-CBR); no bag >32kg safety rule.[10][11]

**Total**: Bus heavy gear to CBR (~$100 + 8h), then fly with 40kg+ checked (e.g., Virgin Business 64kg allowance).[1][2]

This beats direct MEL-CBR flight (1h10m airtime, but capped at 23kg standard).[7] Book Greyhound at greyhound.com.au; check fares for your dates (Feb 2026 peak possible). Drive if you prefer control over bulk.

**Is the Canberra embassy of Sweden far from coach and train terminals or stops from Melbourne?**

The Swedish Embassy in Canberra is only a few kilometres from the main coach and train arrival points, and is easily reached by a short bus or taxi ride.[1][2][3]

#l**Where the embassy is**

- Address: 5 Turrana Street, Yarralumla, ACT 2600.[1][4][3]
- Yarralumla is an inner‑south suburb about 3.5 km south‑west of Canberra’s city centre, on the south side of Lake Burley Griffin.[5]

**From Melbourne coach stop (Civic / Jolimont-style area)**

Most Melbourne–Canberra coaches set down near Canberra’s city centre (Civic).  
From Civic to Yarralumla is about 5–7 km, roughly 10–15 minutes by car or about an hour on foot, with direct bus options (e.g. routes via Regatta Point to Schlich St in Yarralumla taking around 15 minutes).[6][7]

**From Canberra Railway Station (Kingston)**

- Canberra Railway Station is in Kingston, in the inner south.[2]
- From the station you typically take a local bus into City Interchange and then another bus to Yarralumla; Rome2Rio lists a Wentworth Ave (station) → City → Yarralumla bus combo taking about 1 hour in total and costing a few dollars.[2]
- Direct by taxi from the station to Yarralumla is about 7 minutes and under 10 km.[2][8]

**Bottom line for you coming from Melbourne**

- Whether you arrive by coach (Civic) or train (Kingston), the embassy is in the inner suburbs, not on the outskirts, and is relatively close.  
- Expect roughly:
  - 10–15 minutes by taxi or rideshare from either Civic or the railway station.[6][2]
  - 20–60 minutes by bus with one simple transfer from the railway station, or a single short bus from near the lake/Civic side. [6][2][7]
