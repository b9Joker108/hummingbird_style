I have spent the better part of a morning endeavouring to locate a book I read and once owned a print copy of circa twenty-five plus (25+) years ago and I cannot locate it. It is vexing me. It is seminal for:

https://github.com/b9Joker108/hummingbird_style/blob/main/bodywork/props_%26_affordances/introduction_v1_24102025.md

I have consulted circa seven (7) academic monographs on the topic, all published within the past circa twenty (20) years, each with extensive bibliographies and none of them cite it. I have engaged multiple GenerativeAI assistants, no cigar. All the subsequent works I perused are inferior to the work I seek. The author, I remember there only being one, was both a sublime academic and an accomplished practitioner-adept. I know it had: "jhanas/dhyanas/jnanas" in the title or subtitle. I remember the first orthography of the Latin triune in this instance. It had a curious and non-representative title by memory, but was made clear by the subtitle. As tradition and stylistic that some Engl*sh non-fiction researchers and writer's favour: Myself, amongst them. It was on the Early Bauddhadharma, Early Bauddhadharma Cosmology and Early Bauddhadharma Soteriology, particularly trance/meditative states. I read it long, long before my formal and protracted study and practice of all the Bauddhadharma Turnings-of-the-Wheel as instructed by my Dharmarajji Gurudeva, Choegyal Namkha'i Norbu Rinpoche. I puchased it in my very early 20s. So. that is circa thirty (30) years ago and it may have been published up to thirty (30) years prior to that! It informed my meditative sadhana in all subsequent traditions, not just that which is Bauddhadharma-specific. This vexation is a study in 'support' as 'fixation', in one of its negative denotations. Presently, I needsmust release grasping and progress with my day. But, set the sankalpa, for it to arrise in my lifepath, naturally, when timely: By the Grace of Guru and by the Grace of Deva and especially by Shrimati Serendipity and the sublimation of Bibliomancy.

The reason why I spent so much time on this foray this morning, is that I tweaked a spinal stabilization muscle in my upper right back, from my embodied orientation. This provided the impetus and the context for starting the subpage and is to honour The Teacher, in this instantiation and evocation, the Guru of One's Bodymind instantiation.

This audiolog notes the culture of signal noise and signal obfuscation specific to and normalised in proprietary and commercial smartwatches and smartwatch culture amongst smartdevices in particular. The legacy infestation of signal noise, marketed and sold as premium feature, that does not do or measure what it purports to do, is obfuscation, misdirection and without value. This brave new world we are in due to the great technological convergence quickening the Human Condition, mandates diverse qualitative and quantitative signal as invaluable going forward.

**üéôÔ∏è Audio Log: Beauford & A. Stenberg ‚Äì 13 October 2025**

I also saved the weblog *in situ* for probity: https://github.com/b9Joker108/hummingbird_style/blob/main/assets/audio/audiologs/beauford_a_stenberg_audiolog_13102025.m4a but have not figured out, as yet, how to embed the local absolute filepath of it in an audioplayer widget compatible with GFM.

**Sovereign & Future-Proof GFM Audio-Log Embedding Pipeline**

This automated pipeline lets you drop raw .m4a audiologs into your repo and have them rendered as GitHub-playable assets‚Äîwithout external dependencies or manual conversion.

1. Repository Layout

```
/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ raw/               # Your source .m4a files
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ processed/         # Auto-generated .mp4 containers
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audiothumbs/       # (Optional) waveform thumbnails
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audio-convert.yml  # Conversion workflow
```

---

2. GitHub Actions Workflow

Create .github/workflows/audio-convert.yml:

```yaml
name: "Convert Audio Logs to MP4"

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "assets/audio/raw//*.m4a"

jobs:
  transcode:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install FFmpeg
        run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg

      - name: Convert .m4a ‚Üí .mp4
        run: |
          mkdir -p assets/audio/processed
          for src in assets/audio/raw/*.m4a; do
            base=$(basename "$src" .m4a)
            dst="assets/audio/processed/${base}.mp4"
            if [ ! -f "$dst" ]; then
              ffmpeg -y -i "$src" \
                -c:v libx264 -tune stillimage -pix_fmt yuv420p \
                -c:a aac -b:a 192k \
                -shortest "$dst"
            fi
          done

      - name: Commit and push MP4s
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add assets/audio/processed/*.mp4
          git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "chore: add processed audio logs"
          git push
        env:
          GITHUBTOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUBTOKEN }}
```

---

3. (Optional) Waveform Thumbnail Generation

Add before commit step in the workflow:

```bash
mkdir -p assets/images/audiothumbs
for src in assets/audio/raw/*.m4a; do
  base=$(basename "$src" .m4a)
  thumb="assets/images/audiothumbs/${base}.png"
  if [ ! -f "$thumb" ]; then
    ffmpeg -y -i "$src" \
      -filtercomplex "aformat=channellayouts=mono,showwavespic=s=400x100" \
      -frames:v 1 "$thumb"
  fi
done
```

---

4. Embedding Snippet in Markdown

Once the pipeline runs, reference the processed .mp4 and optional waveform in your README.md:

```markdown

üéß Audio Log ‚Äì 13 Oct 2025

!Waveform for 13102025
!Play Beauford & A. Stenberg
```

- GitHub will render a native video player for the .mp4.  
- The waveform PNG provides a visual cue and alt text assists screen readers.

---

5. Benefits & Future-Proofing

- Fully Sovereign: All conversion and thumbnail logic lives in your repo.  
- Automated: New .m4a files trigger MP4 conversion automatically.  
- Accessible: Add meaningful alt text to thumbnails for vision-impaired users.  
- Extensible: Tweak FFmpeg flags, add transcripts, or change containers as needs evolve.

Now, simply push your .m4a logs to assets/audio/raw/‚Äîthe workflow handles the rest.
