# October 2025 #

### Sunday, October 26, 2025 — Saturday, October 25, 2025 ###

It is circa 1.00am Sunday and am I am having trouble sleeping. It has always been the same. When I start some new training regimen or modality, or anticiating a rapidly approaching new experience, or exams, testing or being examinated at something: I always have trouble sleeping. It is neither anxiety nor worry, it is endoctrinal, hormonal, naturally produced adrenaline. For some reason, my endochrine system in these situations, produces adrenaline. It is frustrating and annoying, but that is how is for me, naturally and for as long as I can remember. Otherwise, I never have problems sleeping at all. 

My mind is still as standard and has been so as a matter of course for over twenty (20) years. I only think, when I actively think. By this, I intend, I have no internal voices, no internal monologue and I don't think about things unless I actively choose to do so. There is no thought-compulsion, there is no internal noise. I am not thoughtless, exactly, but my mind is completely still and unmoving. Sleepless, tonight, due to training, I was thinking unbidden. This, as I have stated, is unusual. Thoughts and images, sounds and memories, were playing in the theatre of my mind and imaginal interiority. One, that actually resulted in this weblog entry, was when I was in Grade 5 or 6 in primary school, the penultimate and last years. I don't remember exactly which. I have a slight memory that I wrote of this somewhere, for some reason, not long ago. But, don't remember where. I write much.

My whole year level of students with some other minor inclusions, were in a full olympic-size swimming pool that had been relatively newly built. It was not a school facility, but was walking distance from school. We were all there for a full half day and actually had a lunch of sandwiches, orange juice, milk and an apple or orange provided, prior to doing the theory component and then being in the pool for the balance or the remainder of the school day, for the practical component. They were white bread, I detest white bread. I enjoyed the milk. I didn't drink the juice. I don't remember whether I ate any fruit. The pool was completely filled with students and all students were spaced relatively uniformly and equidistant from one another. There was neither room nor child to spare. We were training for our Bronze Medallion. I remember we had just completed a circa fifteen (15) minute segment on treading water (or doggy paddle). Then, in the following segment, we were instructed to hold our breath under water for as long as possible. Trainers/lifegards/swim-instructers/ring-ins, whatever they bloody were, all of different ages, surrounded us around the pool with clipboards, their whistles and floaties at-the-ready, periodically scrawling something arcane. Anyway, it took us exactly three (3) times, as a group, to all get submerged with a mouthfull of air in a relatively orderly fashion. 

I naturally have a penchant and/or propensity for trance states of different kinds and trance induction of same. Under water, I just went into a natural trance. I didn't think about it, I just did. In water, bar one other time, I have never done its like, before nor since. But, I remember coming out of the trance under water and thinking, observing my self from an external perspective in-a-fashion: How long have you (I) been down here for? I got concerned, anxious somewhat, because, I didn't want to stick out from my peers or be conspicuous in any way. I did that too much as it was. I could have stayed under water for much, much longer. In respect to the principal instructor, I was right at the back of the pool near a corner, two in. I quietly and gently ascend and ever-so-slowly peek and break the water surface and am not in a hurry to breathe. Everyone is silent and unnaturally still and there were a lot of bloody people and they were collectively staring at me intently and they just kept staring at me unblinking saying nothing and unmoving for what felt like an inordinate period of time. I had been underwater for a very, very, long relative period of time. No-one said anything and it was never talked about. But, people, adults and students, were clearly unsettled and it gave my peers another reason to keep me at arm's length and look at me with sidelong glances and with circumspection and derision. Even now, I don't understand why they didn't intervene and bring me up. But, they didn't. I don't know why this memory emerges in my sleepless mind.

I ended up waking up naturally a little later than standard and felt rested and hungry. This feeling of hungry is new. My diet and hydration have been controlled for circa 1.5 years. I focused on hydration amd nutrition first and set-up and established my kitchen and store/pantry/apothecary. It took time. I slowly and progressively increased activity and diversity-of-activity. Even after periodic jogging and light kettlebell and light bodyweight training and controlled diet and hydration and integrating time-restricted eating and intermittent-fasting and 10,000+ steps-a-day, the scales didn't move and I never felt hunger at any stage, even in a strict 48 hour fast with light exercise and resistance training. A few days of introducing bike riding and for the past few days, at different times, I have felt different levels of hunger. So, the bike, for some reason, was the tipping point. This morning, I awoke hungry. It has been quite a number of years since I felt that. I am not a big eater and getting my protein ballpark daily on sequences of back-to-back ONAM has been challenging. So, I have resolved to supplement protein rather than imbibing just natural unprocessed wholefood sources, which I favour. Also, the scales are moving. As my supplier, I settled on grass-fed, raw, unflavoured and unsweetened Whey Protein Isolate (WPI) from Mackintosh Investment Group T/A BlackBelt Protein. I would prefer it to be organic and cruelty-free, but it ticked nearly all of my excessive and stringent list of boxes which I presently choose not to ennumerate. I am waiting for the delivery to arrive. I must commence my day. Journaling consumes much time.

### Friday, October 24, 2025 ###

I have spent the better part of a morning endeavouring to locate a book I read and once owned a print copy of circa twenty-five plus (25+) years ago and I cannot locate it. It is vexing me. It is seminal for:

https://github.com/b9Joker108/hummingbird_style/blob/main/bodywork/props_%26_affordances/introduction_v1_24102025.md

I have consulted circa seven (7) academic monographs on the topic, all published within the past circa twenty (20) years, each with extensive bibliographies and none of them cite it. I have engaged multiple GenerativeAI assistants, no cigar. All the subsequent works I perused are inferior to the work I seek. The author, I remember there only being one, was both a sublime academic and an accomplished practitioner-adept. I know it had: "jhanas/dhyanas/jnanas" in the title or subtitle. I remember the first orthography of the Latin triune in this instance. It had a curious and non-representative title by memory, but was made clear by the subtitle. As tradition and stylistic that some English non-fiction researchers and writer's favour: Myself, amongst them. It was on the Early Bauddhadharma, Early Bauddhadharma Cosmology and Early Bauddhadharma Soteriology, particularly trance/meditative states. I read it long, long before my formal and protracted study and practice of all the Bauddhadharma Turnings-of-the-Wheel as instructed by my Dharmarajji Gurudeva, H.E. Choegyal Namkha'i Norbu Rinpoche. I puchased it in my very early 20s. So. that is circa thirty (30) years ago and it may have been published up to thirty (30) years prior to that! It informed my meditative sadhana in all subsequent traditions, not just that which is Bauddhadharma-specific. This vexation is a study in 'support' as 'fixation', in one of its negative denotations. Presently, I needsmust release grasping and progress with my day. But, set the sankalpa, for it to arrise in my lifepath, naturally, when timely: By the Grace of Guru and by the Grace of Deva and especially by Shrimati Serendipity and the sublimation of Bibliomancy.

The reason why I spent so much time on this foray this morning, is that I tweaked a spinal stabilization muscle yesterday whilst doing a subtle everyday movement, closing my front door with the slightest of effort after returning early-morning from the postoffice, in my upper right back, to disambiguate directionality, I convey lexically, from my embodied orientation, not that of external perspective or perception. This provided the impetus and the context for starting the subpage and is to honour The Teacher, in this instantiation and evocation, the Guru of One's Bodymind instantiation. The movement was so subtle and had no significant movent-in-space, that it seemingly didn't warrant the tweaking of the muscle that resulted. So, why did it happen? Such things can happen at any age and in all degrees of ableness and trained propensity, or otherwise. So, why did it happen? I have been doing preparatory balancework for yogavinyasa, hybrid bodyweight training and giriwork over the past circa four (4) weeks and have gone bike riding for the past three (3) days, consecutively, on my new pushbike. So, my stabilizers are being, tried, calibrated and keened. This, from a life's bodywork experience, is standard experiential fodder, but try to locate it in the discouse and you will encounter issue. Doing a days errand-running yesterday and this morning's 'fruitless' research endeavour and writing this weblog and editing it, I am just about to commence ritual holy bath at circa 11.30am and all trace of the discomfiture and pain has ceased. The heat of the bath will reveal if there is any remaining inflammation in the locality.

I generally bathe twice, in quick succession, for a deeply triangulated cascading array of reasons. In the first bathe, without planning or discursive thought, it spontaneously arose and was resolved, to take secondses in a natural body of saltwater. This surprised me greatly! So, it is cold and cloudy and off-we-go on pushbike! This was not how I anticipated that I would be spending my early noon. The heat of the bath revealed a ghost or phantasm of the muscle-twinge.

Just after 5.00pm I got in the door. I spent the vast balance of that on-bike. I had three (3) quick dips in the saltwater, just tokenism. Water quality according to the Authority was 'Poor'; so, eyes, face and ears didn't get wet. I picked up a large, fresh, wild-caught Taylor and stuffed it with some remaining peach pieces in fruit juice that were openned in the refrigerator and did fifteen (15) minutes of giriwork whilst it cooked. I stopped, as I felt ever-so-slightly dizzy. I have been fasting all day. The prashadam in the lila of Pomatomus saltatrix (Linnaeus 1766) was delicious!

This audiolog notes the culture of signal noise and signal obfuscation specific to and normalised in proprietary and commercial smartwatches and smartwatch culture amongst smartdevices in particular. The legacy infestation of signal noise, marketed and sold as premium feature, that does not do or measure what it purports to do, is obfuscation, misdirection and without value. This brave new world we are in due to the great technological convergence quickening the Human Condition, mandates diverse qualitative and quantitative signal as invaluable going forward.

**🎙️ Audio Log: Beauford & A. Stenberg – 13 October 2025**

Listen to beauford_a_stenberg_audiolog_13102025.m4a by B9HHAvadhutaNecr0prancer! on #SoundCloud
https://on.soundcloud.com/SSkqej6rLQgTMtVm4p

I also saved the weblog *in situ* for probity: https://github.com/b9Joker108/hummingbird_style/blob/main/assets/audio/audiologs/beauford_a_stenberg_audiolog_13102025.m4a but have not figured out, as yet, how to embed the local absolute filepath of it in an audioplayer widget compatible with GFM.

**Sovereign & Future-Proof GFM Audio-Log Embedding Pipeline**

This automated pipeline lets you drop raw .m4a audiologs into your repo and have them rendered as GitHub-playable assets—without external dependencies or manual conversion.

---

1. Repository Layout

```
/
├── assets/
│   ├── audio/
│   │   ├── raw/               # Your source .m4a files
│   │   └── processed/         # Auto-generated .mp4 containers
│   └── images/
│       └── audiothumbs/       # (Optional) waveform thumbnails
├── README.md
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── audio-convert.yml  # Conversion workflow
```

---

2. GitHub Actions Workflow

Create .github/workflows/audio-convert.yml:

```yaml
name: "Convert Audio Logs to MP4"

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "assets/audio/raw//*.m4a"

jobs:
  transcode:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install FFmpeg
        run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg

      - name: Convert .m4a → .mp4
        run: |
          mkdir -p assets/audio/processed
          for src in assets/audio/raw/*.m4a; do
            base=$(basename "$src" .m4a)
            dst="assets/audio/processed/${base}.mp4"
            if [ ! -f "$dst" ]; then
              ffmpeg -y -i "$src" \
                -c:v libx264 -tune stillimage -pix_fmt yuv420p \
                -c:a aac -b:a 192k \
                -shortest "$dst"
            fi
          done

      - name: Commit and push MP4s
        run: |
          git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git add assets/audio/processed/*.mp4
          git diff --cached --quiet || git commit -m "chore: add processed audio logs"
          git push
        env:
          GITHUBTOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUBTOKEN }}
```

---

3. (Optional) Waveform Thumbnail Generation

Add before commit step in the workflow:

```bash
mkdir -p assets/images/audiothumbs
for src in assets/audio/raw/*.m4a; do
  base=$(basename "$src" .m4a)
  thumb="assets/images/audiothumbs/${base}.png"
  if [ ! -f "$thumb" ]; then
    ffmpeg -y -i "$src" \
      -filtercomplex "aformat=channellayouts=mono,showwavespic=s=400x100" \
      -frames:v 1 "$thumb"
  fi
done
```

---

4. Embedding Snippet in Markdown

Once the pipeline runs, reference the processed .mp4 and optional waveform in your README.md:

```markdown

🎧 Audio Log – 13 Oct 2025

!Waveform for 13102025
!Play Beauford & A. Stenberg
```

- GitHub will render a native video player for the .mp4.  
- The waveform PNG provides a visual cue and alt text assists screen readers.

---

5. Benefits & Future-Proofing

- Fully Sovereign: All conversion and thumbnail logic lives in your repo.  
- Automated: New .m4a files trigger MP4 conversion automatically.  
- Accessible: Add meaningful alt text to thumbnails for vision-impaired users.  
- Extensible: Tweak FFmpeg flags, add transcripts, or change containers as needs evolve.

Now, simply push your .m4a logs to assets/audio/raw/—the workflow handles the rest.
