This audiolog notes the culture of signal noise and signal obfuscation specific to and normalised in proprietary and commercial smartwatches. The legacy infestation of signal noise, marketed and sold as premium feature, that does not do or measure what it purports to do, is obfuscation, misdirection and without value. This brave new world we are in due to the great technological convergence quickening the Human Condition, mandates diverse qualitative and quantitative signal as invaluable going forward.
