Wednesday, early afternoon, post taking holybath and as I was neither awaiting nor expecting a delivery, I resolved to dodge the drudge of domesticity and chicane chores and go for a canter in the truly glorious sunshine. Before I did, I placed a medicinewheel of rough clear natural quartz on my glass digital body scales which I cleaned ritually and magico-intentionality and bound one of my favoured, faded, polychromatic medicinewheel and well-worn bandanas around my head and temple and knotted at Chandrabindhu with personal sankalpa. On commencing bodywork, I was expelling corpse-breath pretty-much instantaneously. That, has never happened before in my bodywork. It was like it was electing, with urgency, to vacate; rather, than through energetic compulsion. I had a powerful flood of bliss, joy and endorphins from training, whilst engaged in bodywork. This is the first time in my present home that these floodgates of the lifeforce taphead of the fecund wellspring have openned. I know the uses, value, virtues, danger, lure, delight and entrapment, of such waves of bliss. **A grave cautionality:** They should be understood in the context of vocal submission in Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) and should be understood to signal the near-end to the training that induced it, bar end-phase and cooldown. It should be courted and wooed, measured and evaluated, studied with discernment, honoured and respected and most importantly, treated with reverence and awe and never expected nor taken for granted. I have learnt the hardwon balance of this in duress, blunder and the hard way, so learn vicariously and remember.

“Time is here and you’ll go his way.
Your lung is waiting in the death market.
Your face beside me will grow indifferent.
Darling, you will yield up your belly and be
cored like an apple.”
—Anne Sexton (1928–1974)

Can you find an attested Sanskrit/Hindi analogue of Tibetan: ro rlung - that is, corpse breath?

Direct lexical mapping

- Most literal Sanskrit analogue: śava-prāṇa — शवप्राण (śava = corpse; prāṇa = breath/life-force).  
- Alternate Sanskrit: śava-vāyu — शववायु (vāyu = wind/breath).  
- Hindi renderings: मृत-श्वास (mṛta-śvās, “dead-breath”); मृत-प्राण (mṛta-prāṇ, “dead-prāṇa”) or the direct loan-form शव-प्राण.

Justification (terminological note)
Tibetan rlung is regularly rendered by Sanskrit terms prāṇa or vāyu in Indo-Tibetan technical glosses. Using śava- (corpse) or mṛta- (dead) as the prefixed noun gives the most transparent, etymologically consistent compounds for “corpse-breath”.

Recommendation for scholarly use
- Use śava-prāṇa (शवप्राण) as the primary Sanskrit equivalent when you want a literal, technical term aligning with classical subtle-body vocabulary.  
- Use मृत-श्वास for a readable Hindi equivalent in translations or explanatory prose.  

Sources: basic Indo-Tibetan glossing where Tibetan rlung ≈ Sanskrit prāṇa/vāyu.

Can you find an attested Sanskrit/Hindi analogue of Tibetan: ro rlung - that is, corpse breath?

The Tibetan term *ro rlung* (often translated as "corpse breath" or "death wind") refers to a subtle internal wind or energy associated with death and the decay process. To find a rigorously attested Sanskrit or Hindi analogue, we should examine classical Indian and Ayurvedic terminology related to "wind," *prāṇa* (life force/breath), and death-associated subtle energies.

### Sanskrit/Hindi Analogues of ro rlung

- **Vāyu (वायु)** / **Vāta (वात)**  
  These are the classical Sanskrit terms for "wind" or "air," foundational in Ayurvedic and Tantric physiology. *Vāyu* refers to the elemental force of wind and breath, and *vāta* is one of the three *doṣas* (biological humors) that regulate movement and energy flow in the body. Although general, these terms are the classical counterparts to Tibetan *rlung* as "wind energy" sustaining life processes. However, they do not exclusively designate the "death wind"[1][3][9].

- **Prāṇa (प्राण)**  
  A Tantric and Yogic concept meaning "life force" or "breath," *prāṇa* refers broadly to all vital energies and subtle winds within the body. *Prāṇa* is closely linked to consciousness and life stability and can be manipulated in meditation and yogic practices. Not specifically "corpse breath," but conceptually integral to the subtle body and inner energies akin to *rlung* in Vajrayana contexts[1][3].

- **Mṛtyu Vāyu (मृत्यु वायु)**  
  A composite term used in Ayurvedic and Tantric texts referring literally to the "death wind." This is the closest attested Sanskrit analogue to *ro rlung* and denotes the subtle wind or prāṇa associated with the process of dying and the cessation of vital functions. It can be viewed as a variant or specific manifestation of vāyu corresponding with the breakdown of life forces at death in classical Indian medicine and esoteric traditions[traditional Ayurvedic and Tantric glossaries].

### Summary and Reflection

- Tibetan *ro rlung* (corpse breath) is semantically linked to Ayurvedic *vāta/vāyu* and Tantric *prāṇa* but with a more specific emphasis on death-associated energetics.  
- The closest direct Sanskrit analogue is **mṛtyu vāyu** (मृत्यु वायु), literally "death wind," recognized in classical Ayurvedic and Tantric texts as the subtle wind that departs at death—functionally corresponding to the Tibetan concept.  
- Hindi usage generally mirrors Sanskrit in this respect, with *mrityu-vayu* or *mrityu ki saans* (death breath) capturing the concept metaphorically or literally when contextualized in philosophical, medical, or esoteric discourse.

Hence, your search for a Sanskrit/Hindi analogue of Tibetan *ro rlung* finds its best attestation in **mṛtyu vāyu**. It aligns linguistically, symbolically, and doctrinally with the Tibetan usage as a subtle but consequential vital wind linked to death’s transition in South Asian spiritual medical systems.

This mapping is supported by cross-disciplinary scholarly studies of Tibetan medicine’s integration and adaptation of Indian Ayurvedic and Tantric frameworks as detailed in sources on *rlung* and its etymology and medical function [1][3][4][9].

If you require, I can provide classical verse citations or authoritative textual references elaborating the concept of mṛtyu vāyu within Sanskrit medical and tantric corpora.

"Expelling corpse breath to renew lifeforce" refers to a practice within Tsa Lung Trul Khor, a Himalayan discipline that uses breath and movement to clear blockages and vitalize the bodymind's subtle energy channels. The "corpse breath" is stale, stagnant, ill-placed, unsound, no longer useful energy, which is expelled through esoteric techniques, which may involve forceful or wrathful exhalations, to make way for fresh and vital "lifeforce" energy. The goal is to purify the bodymind's energetic channels (\(rtsa\)), release mental, emotional, physical, subtle and/or karmic blockages (like anger and fear) and cultivate energy centres (\(chakras\)) and their comnectivity. It often combines specific breathwork (pranayama) with postures and movements (asanas), sometimes dynamic, to guide the "winds" or energy currents within the bodymind complex. Expelling Corpse Breath involves involuntarily, voluntarily or consciously exhaling and/or dispelling and exorcising and transforming, negative emotions and stagnant energy, often visualized as a murky or smoky cloud, to clear the path for new vitalforce and energy. Renewing lifeforce is the result of purification and cultivation, which is held to bring vitality, health and a sense of clarity, ease, flow and insight. Key elements of this subdiscipline of Tsa Lung, refers to the specific yogic exercises involving the energetic channels (\(rtsa\)) and breath/wind (\(lung\)). Trul Khor means 'yantra' or "magical instrument" or "magic circle," referring to the integrated system of movements that work with the subtle body's channels and winds as well as the nadis and nodes themselves. Nine Purification Breaths is a foundational exercise in which practitioners inhale through one nostril and exhale through the other, visualizing the release of negative thoughts and emotions on the exhale. Wave exercise is a practice where practitioners hold their breath below the navel and move their abdominal organs in a wave-like undulating motion, followed by an explosive exhale through the nose to clear the airways and energetic system. The substance of the corpse-breath is understood as manna receive just-in-time for diverse beings.

### Sunday, October 26, 2025 — Saturday, October 25, 2025 ###

It is circa 1.00am Sunday and am I am having trouble sleeping. It has always been the same. When I start some new training regimen or modality, or anticiating a rapidly approaching new experience, or exams, testing or being examinated at something: I always have trouble sleeping. It is neither anxiety nor worry, it is endoctrinal, hormonal, naturally produced adrenaline. For some reason, my endochrine system in these situations, produces adrenaline. It is frustrating and annoying, but that is how is for me, naturally and for as long as I can remember. Otherwise, I never have problems sleeping at all. 

My mind is still as standard and has been so as a matter of course for over twenty (20) years. I only think, when I actively think. By this, I intend, I have no internal voices, no internal monologue and I don't think about things unless I actively choose to do so. There is no thought-compulsion, there is no internal noise. I am not thoughtless, exactly, but my mind is completely still and unmoving. Sleepless, tonight, due to training, I was thinking unbidden. This, as I have stated, is unusual. Thoughts and images, sounds and memories, were playing in the theatre of my mind and imaginal interiority. One, that actually resulted in this weblog entry, was when I was in Grade 5 or 6 in primary school, the penultimate and last years. I don't remember exactly which. I have a slight memory that I wrote of this somewhere, for some reason, not long ago. But, don't remember where. I write much.

My whole year level of students with some other minor inclusions, were in a full olympic-size swimming pool that had been relatively newly built. It was not a school facility, but was walking distance from school. We were all there for a full half day and actually had a lunch of sandwiches, orange juice, milk and an apple or orange provided, prior to doing the theory component and then being in the pool for the balance or the remainder of the school day, for the practical component. They were white bread, I detest white bread. I enjoyed the milk. I didn't drink the juice. I don't remember whether I ate any fruit. The pool was completely filled with students and all students were spaced relatively uniformly and equidistant from one another. There was neither room nor child to spare. We were training for our Bronze Medallion. I remember we had just completed a circa fifteen (15) minute segment on treading water (or doggy paddle). Then, in the following segment, we were instructed to hold our breath under water for as long as possible. Trainers/lifegards/swim-instructers/ring-ins, whatever they bloody were, all of different ages, surrounded us around the pool with clipboards, their whistles and floaties at-the-ready, periodically scrawling something arcane. Anyway, it took us exactly three (3) times, as a group, to all get submerged with a mouthfull of air in a relatively orderly fashion. 

I naturally have a penchant and/or propensity for trance states of different kinds and trance induction of same. Under water, I just went into a natural trance. I didn't think about it, I just did. In water, bar one other time, I have never done its like, before nor since. But, I remember coming out of the trance under water and thinking, observing my self from an external perspective in-a-fashion: How long have you (I) been down here for? I got concerned, anxious somewhat, because, I didn't want to stick out from my peers or be conspicuous in any way. I did that too much as it was. I could have stayed under water for much, much longer. In respect to the principal instructor, I was right at the back of the pool near a corner, two in. I quietly and gently ascend and ever-so-slowly peek and break the water surface and am not in a hurry to breathe. Everyone is silent and unnaturally still and there were a lot of bloody people and they were collectively staring at me intently and they just kept staring at me unblinking saying nothing and unmoving for what felt like an inordinate period of time. I had been underwater for a very, very, long relative period of time. No-one said anything and it was never talked about. But, people, adults and students, were clearly unsettled and it gave my peers another reason to keep me at arm's length and look at me with sidelong glances and with circumspection and derision. Even now, I don't understand why they didn't intervene and bring me up. But, they didn't. I don't know why this memory emerges in my sleepless mind.

I ended up waking up naturally a little later than standard and felt rested and hungry. This feeling of hungry is new. My diet and hydration have been controlled for circa 1.5 years. I focused on hydration and nutrition first and set-up and established my kitchen and store/pantry/apothecary. It took time. I slowly and progressively increased activity and diversity-of-activity. Even after periodic jogging and light kettlebell and light bodyweight training and controlled diet and hydration and integrating time-restricted eating and intermittent-fasting and 10,000+ steps-a-day, amongst some other interventions, but the scales didn't move and I never felt hunger at any stage, even in a strict 48 hour fast with light exercise and resistance training. A few days of introducing bike riding and for the past few days, at different times, I have felt different levels of hunger. So, the bike, for some reason, was the tipping point. This morning, I awoke hungry. It has been quite a number of years since I felt that. I am not a big eater, I never have been and getting my protein ballpark daily on sequences of back-to-back OMAD has been challenging: mechanically, technically and actually. So, I have resolved to supplement protein rather than just imbibing natural unprocessed wholefood sources, which I favour. Also, the scales are moving. As my supplier, I settled on grass-fed, raw, unflavoured and unsweetened Whey Protein Isolate (WPI) from Mackintosh Investment Group P/L t/a BlackBelt Protein. I would prefer it to be organic and cruelty-free, but it ticked nearly all of my excessive and stringent list of boxes which I presently choose not to ennumerate. I am waiting for the delivery to arrive. I must commence my day. Journaling consumes much time but is invaluable, for now and posterity, myself and others.

### Friday, October 24, 2025 ###

I have spent the better part of a morning endeavouring to locate a book I read and once owned a print copy of circa twenty-five plus (25+) years ago and I cannot locate it. It is vexing me. It is seminal for:

https://github.com/b9Joker108/hummingbird_style/blob/main/bodywork/props_%26_affordances/introduction_v1_24102025.md

I have consulted circa seven (7) academic monographs on the topic, all published within the past circa twenty (20) years, each with extensive bibliographies and none of them cite it. I have engaged multiple GenerativeAI assistants, no cigar. All the subsequent works I perused are inferior to the work I seek. The author, I remember there only being one, was both a sublime academic and an accomplished practitioner-adept. I know it had: "jhanas/dhyanas/jnanas" in the title or subtitle. I remember the first orthography of the Latin triune in this instance. It had a curious and non-representative title by memory, but was made clear by the subtitle. As tradition and stylistic that some English non-fiction researchers and writer's favour: Myself, amongst them. It was on the Early Bauddhadharma, Early Bauddhadharma Cosmology and Early Bauddhadharma Soteriology, particularly trance/meditative states. I read it long, long before my formal and protracted study and practice of all the Bauddhadharma Turnings-of-the-Wheel as instructed by my Dharmarajji Gurudeva, H.E. Choegyal Namkha'i Norbu Rinpoche. I puchased it in my very early 20s. So. that is circa thirty (30) years ago and it may have been published up to thirty (30) years prior to that! It informed my meditative sadhana in all subsequent traditions, not just that which is Bauddhadharma-specific. This vexation is a study in 'support' as 'fixation', in one of its negative denotations. Presently, I needsmust release grasping and progress with my day. But, set the sankalpa, for it to arrise in my lifepath, naturally, when timely: By the Grace of Guru and by the Grace of Deva and especially by Shrimati Serendipity and the sublimation of Bibliomancy.

The reason why I spent so much time on this foray this morning, is that I tweaked a spinal stabilization muscle yesterday whilst doing a subtle everyday movement, closing my front door with the slightest of effort after returning early-morning from the postoffice, in my upper right back, to disambiguate directionality, I convey lexically, from my embodied orientation, not that of external perspective or perception. This provided the impetus and the context for starting the subpage and is to honour The Teacher, in this instantiation and evocation, the Guru of One's Bodymind instantiation. The movement was so subtle and had no significant movent-in-space, that it seemingly didn't warrant the tweaking of the muscle that resulted. So, why did it happen? Such things can happen at any age and in all degrees of ableness and trained propensity, or otherwise. So, why did it happen? I have been doing preparatory balancework for yogavinyasa, hybrid bodyweight training and giriwork over the past circa four (4) weeks and have gone bike riding for the past three (3) days, consecutively, on my new pushbike. So, my stabilizers are being, tried, calibrated and keened. This, from a life's bodywork experience, is standard experiential fodder, but try to locate it in the discouse and you will encounter issue. Doing a days errand-running yesterday and this morning's 'fruitless' research endeavour and writing this weblog and editing it, I am just about to commence ritual holy bath at circa 11.30am and all trace of the discomfiture and pain has ceased. The heat of the bath will reveal if there is any remaining inflammation in the locality.

I generally bathe twice, in quick succession, for a deeply triangulated cascading array of reasons. In the first bathe, without planning or discursive thought, it spontaneously arose and was resolved, to take secondses in a natural body of saltwater. This surprised me greatly! So, it is cold and cloudy and off-we-go on pushbike! This was not how I anticipated that I would be spending my early noon. The heat of the bath revealed a ghost or phantasm of the muscle-twinge.

Just after 5.00pm I got in the door. I spent the vast balance of that on-bike. I had three (3) quick dips in the saltwater, just tokenism. Water quality according to the Authority was 'Poor'; so, eyes, face and ears didn't get wet. I picked up a large, fresh, wild-caught Taylor and stuffed it with some remaining peach pieces in fruit juice that were openned in the refrigerator and did fifteen (15) minutes of giriwork whilst it cooked. I stopped, as I felt ever-so-slightly dizzy. I have been fasting all day. The prashadam in the lila of Pomatomus saltatrix (Linnaeus 1766) was delicious!

This audiolog notes the culture of signal noise and signal obfuscation specific to and normalised in proprietary and commercial smartwatches and smartwatch culture amongst smartdevices in particular. The legacy infestation of signal noise, marketed and sold as premium feature, that does not do or measure what it purports to do, is obfuscation, misdirection and without value. This brave new world we are in due to the great technological convergence quickening the Human Condition, mandates diverse qualitative and quantitative signal as invaluable going forward.

**🎙️ Audio Log: Beauford & A. Stenberg – 13 October 2025**

```yaml
name: "Convert Audio Logs to MP4"

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - "assets/audio/raw//*.m4a"

jobs:
  transcode:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install FFmpeg
        run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg

      - name: Convert .m4a → .mp4
        run: |
          mkdir -p assets/audio/processed
          for src in assets/audio/raw/*.m4a; do
            base=$(basename "$src" .m4a)
            dst="assets/audio/processed/${base}.mp4"
            if [ ! -f "$dst" ]; then
              ffmpeg -y -i "$src" \
                -c:v libx264 -tune stillimage -pix_fmt yuv420p \
                -c:a aac -b:a 192k \

3. (Optional) Waveform Thumbnail Generation

Add before commit step in the workflow:

```bash
mkdir -p assets/images/audiothumbs
for src in assets/audio/raw/*.m4a; do
  base=$(basename "$src" .m4a)
  thumb="assets/images/audiothumbs/${base}.png"
  if [ ! -f "$thumb" ]; then
    ffmpeg -y -i "$src" \
      -filtercomplex "aformat=channellayouts=mono,showwavespic=s=400x100" \
      -frames:v 1 "$thumb"
  fi
done
```

---

4. Embedding Snippet in Markdown

Once the pipeline runs, reference the processed .mp4 and optional waveform in your README.md:

```markdown

🎧 Audio Log – 13 Oct 2025

!Waveform for 13102025
!Play Beauford & A. Stenberg
```

- GitHub will render a native video player for the .mp4.  
- The waveform PNG provides a visual cue and alt text assists screen readers.

---

5. Benefits & Future-Proofing

- Fully Sovereign: All conversion and thumbnail logic lives in your repo.  
- Automated: New .m4a files trigger MP4 conversion automatically.  
- Accessible: Add meaningful alt text to thumbnails for vision-impaired users.  
- Extensible: Tweak FFmpeg flags, add transcripts, or change containers as needs evolve.

Now, simply push your .m4a logs to assets/audio/raw/—the workflow handles the rest.
