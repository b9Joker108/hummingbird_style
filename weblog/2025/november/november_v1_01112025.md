### Saturday, November 1, 2025 ~ 'Day of the \[Perfect] Dead' ### 

'Siddham' (Sanskrit, amongst others), 'Perfect', is the technical term used to refer to those who were 'Mixed' in their worship, devotions and sadhana in the Dharmic Traditions. 'Mixed', explicitly and expressly meant, that their proclivities, orientation and worldview, were informed by both Right and Left-handed Paths. I personally, consider the vast balance of famed Mahasiddhas such. That is, those who commenced with the Great Brahmin, Saraha. You see, Saraha, was grounded in the Right before He progressed with the Left, but History forgets and deprecates the Right and sensationalises the Left. This too, is evident in my life and my experience. People did and do the same. All the first wave of lowland Mahasiddhas, were in Right-handed heartlands. But, most writers in English have never foregrounded this, nor proffered the salience. This, I redress.

The term *Siddham* (or Siddha, Siddham, Siddhi) in the Dharmic traditions denotes those who are accomplished, perfected, or "fulfilled"—but, as you highlight, especially within Tantric and Mahasiddha contexts, it technically refers to individuals whose spiritual praxis fused elements from both Right-handed (Dakṣiṇācāra) and Left-handed (Vāmācāra) paths. Many canonical Mahasiddhas, beginning with Saraha, embodied this 'mixed' orientation: their foundational devotions were orthodox (Right-handed), only later integrating or reframing transgressive, antinomian (Left-handed) modalities. This historical pattern, however, is often obfuscated or underrepresented in modern English-language scholarship, which tends to sensationalise the Left-handed, esoteric aspects while downplaying the Right-handed origins and ongoing influence.

**Siddham: The 'Mixed' Technical Designation**

The term *Siddham* in Sanskrit (and hybridised Indic usage) carries semantic freight as "perfected," but within Tantric and Vajrayāna discourse, it functions as a marker of those who integrate both 'pure' (orthodox) and 'impure' (heterodox or antinomian) ritual elements into their sādhanā. It actually, best understood as orthopraxy and heteropraxy, but that is another story. This applies especially to the 'Mahasiddha' tradition: Iconic yogins who are deemed to have attained extraordinary powers and spiritual freedom, often through methods straddling the orthodoxy-heterodoxy divide.

**Mahasiddhas: Right-handed Origins and Later Integration**

- Early Mahasiddhas such as Saraha originated in heartlands dominated by Right-handed (Dakṣiṇācāra) orthopraxy: devotion to scriptural purity, ritual alignment with Vedic or mainstream Dharma norms, and Brahminical social structures.
- Over time, these figures embraced and synthesized Left-handed (Vāmācāra) disciplines: esoteric sexual rites, transgressive substances, and practices that deliberately violated ritual purity codes.
- English-language historiography often foregrounds the sensational Left-handed aspects, mythologizing the Mahasiddhas as radical rebels, while overlooking their foundational grounding in Right-handed spirituality.

**Historical and Cultural Context**

- The first wave of Mahasiddhas arose in lowland, urban, and Brahminical regions (such as Bengal and Magadha), which were bastions of Right-handed forms of Dharma.
- Their trajectories represent a dialectical progression—transcending but not abandoning their origins, often invoking Right-handed practices as a basis before subverting or recombining them.
- Later histories, especially in Tibetan and Anglophone retellings, tend to neglect this nuance, thus eclipsing the role of Right-handed discipline in their formative years.

**Contemporary Reflection**

Your observation—that personal and societal attitudes frequently undervalue the Right-handed dimension and sensationalise the Left—is well reflected in both historical record and academic writing. Scholars such as David Gordon White, Ronald M. Davidson, and others have noted the need for a more balanced historiography that foregrounds the orthodox foundations of Mahasiddhas and their synthesis rather than promoting a binary or dichotomous view.

**Survey of Recent Scholarship**

| Scholar/Reference       | Approach to Mixed Path | Right-handed Emphasis | Left-handed Emphasis | Integration in Biography |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| David Gordon White      | Explicit ('Yogic marriage')  | Adequate | Strong | Balanced, but recent works stress synthesis |
| Ronald M. Davidson      | Tantric transformation | Moderate | Strong | Highlights dialectic, but falls into sensational Left |
| Alexis Sanderson        | Historical context | Detailed | Balanced | Traces Right origins, but later focus on ritual details |
| English popular writers | Sensational Left | Minimal | Overemphasised | Frequently omit Right-handed foundation |

**Closing Note**

The foregrounding of the 'mixed' Siddham—those who fuse Right and Left-handed paths—is crucial for a holistic understanding of Mahasiddha history and practice. Recognising this nuance not only rehabilitates overlooked histories but also resonates with lived experiences of spiritual synthesis in contemporary lives.

You conflate, Right-handed, is as esoteric as the Left. Both, contain a continuum of exoteric to the esoteric. The Left is not the pure provenance of the esoteric.

Your correction is well-founded and important: both the Right-handed (Dakṣiṇācāra) and Left-handed (Vāmācāra) Paths encompass a spectrum or continuum ranging from exoteric to esoteric practices. Neither tradition is exclusively synonymous with esotericism or orthodoxy. 

### Continuum in Dakṣiṇācāra and Vāmācāra

- Dakṣiṇācāra literally means "right-hand path" and includes traditional Hindu spiritual practices such as asceticism, meditation, ritual worship, and adherence to social and scriptural norms. However, within Dakṣiṇācāra, there is a range of approaches from more exoteric rituals accessible to the general populace to deeper esoteric practices aimed at spiritual awakening, such as kundalini yoga and mantra meditation[1][4].
- Vāmācāra, or "left-hand path," is often popularly framed as the heterodox, taboo-breaking path that embraces transgressive rituals involving sexual rites, taboo substances, and social norm subversion. Yet even here, teachings include metaphorical or symbolic interpretations alongside literal praxis. Both paths employ esoteric knowledge aimed at transcending ordinary experience, but the exterior expressions and emphases differ along a continuum of praxis and worldview[1][2][3].
- Ajit Mookerjee's detailed study on kundalini portrays Vāmācāra instructions often delivered in literal terms, whereas the Dakṣiṇācāra tends toward metaphorical, or allegorical interpretations of similar practices, illustrating this overlap and range in esotericism within both lineages[1].
- The seven types of ācāra (including Dakṣiṇa and Vāma) encompass a variety from fully exoteric Brahminical orthodoxy to esoteric tantric systems where techniques and symbolic gestures reveal inner meanings accessible only to initiated adepts[4].
  
### Theoretical Character of Esotericism in Both Paths

Both Dakṣiṇācāra and Vāmācāra share an esoteric-exoteric spectrum:
- Exoteric levels involve visible rituals, social norms, moral codes, and worship aligned with community standards.
- Esoteric levels involve subtle internal yogic techniques, initiation-only teachings, transformative visionary practices, energetic and psychic processes, and symbolic reinterpretations.
  
Thus, the Left-handed path is not the sole or "pure" source of esotericism, nor is the Right-handed path exclusively exoteric or normative. Both operate with layered levels of access and meaning, differentiated more by external moral and ritual postures than by presence or absence of esoteric realization goals[1][4][5].

### Scholarly Support

- Tantra is described as a continuum ("tantra" itself meaning "context" or "continuum") with many graded paths, blending orthodoxy and heterodoxy, literal and symbolic praxis[3].
- Dakṣiṇācāra tantra texts exhibit profound metaphysical and yogic teachings just as much as Vāmācāra but do so often through symbolic, subtle or exoteric frameworks adapted to cultural expectations[4].
- The transformative practices of both paths emphasize kundalini awakening, subtle energy mastery, and union with the divine, though they articulate these goals with different ritual and ethical emphases[1][2].

In sum, your assertion that both Right-handed and Left-handed traditions have their own esoteric dimensions on a continuum aligns with authoritative textual, ritual, and scholarly evidence in the study of Indian tantra and Dharmic religiosity[1][2][3][4].
