I am still a bit body-chunky, over-heavy for inversions and carrying unnecessary bodyfat, but I have well-metabolised such a vast amount of visceral adiposity, so preternaturally quickly, it gives one pause. Digitally, I have been progressing LinkedIn for future linkages according to my Divine and Auspicious Vision; as well as Insta and Threads, principally with bodyworkers of substandard, peppered with a few possible future friends and/or lovers and some auspicious family of consequence. Svenska needsmust play second fiddle just for the interim as I keen my bodymind-continuum for translation to Sverige, my hearthome. Even though somewhat chunky, my skyclad form is now aesthetic to my hawkeye. That said, I still do not understand why people value and appreciate one physical form of mine as-different to-another. It perplexes me greatly. I think and feel no more or less about a person according to their station, bodytype or dress, etc. I do appreciate fashion, finesse, fine things, but I am not beholden to them and they do not constrain and confound me. This world will be saved and preserved within the ken of my Divine and Auspicious Vision. I plan on getting a puppy of substandard as-soon-as-possible in Sverige and will take advisement on breed and bloodline. I too, wish to secure a Gotland pony for my own personal reasons. I am not sure presently, exactly why. But, it accords with my vision.

### ..., December 20, 2025 ###

**Zoom isn't available on my somewhat smart smartwatch: Are there SOTA sovereign alt.'s?**

Here’s the straight, defensible picture, Beauford: Grounded in the search results and then filtered through your actual constraint ~ A “somewhat smart” smartwatch that cannot run Zoom, and your desire for SOTA, sovereign‑leaning alternatives.

**🧭 First: What the search results actually tell us**

* The sources list mainstream Zoom alternatives: RingCentral, Dialpad, Microsoft Teams, etc., .... 
* None of them mention smartwatch‑native support, and none are “sovereign” in the sense of self‑hosted, privacy‑preserving or non‑US‑cloud‑dependent.

So we have to interpret your question through two filters:

1. Sovereign / self‑hosted / privacy‑respecting  
2. Lightweight enough to run on a constrained wearable OS

The search results don’t directly answer that, so I’ll synthesize the landscape for you.

**🛡️ Sovereign, SOTA, Lightweight Alternatives to Zoom**

NB: Ranked by feasibility on a smartwatch.

**1. Jitsi Meet (self‑hosted or EU‑hosted)**

- Open‑source, sovereign‑friendly  
- Can be run on your own server  
- Browser‑based mode sometimes works on wearable browsers  
- Most realistic option for a smartwatch because it can degrade to audio‑only

**Feasibility on smartwatch**

✔ Audio‑only mode often works  
✖ Full video unlikely  
✔ Sovereign control if self‑hosted

**2. Mumble (VoIP, ultra‑lightweight, open‑source)**

- Not video, but state‑of‑the‑art low‑latency audio  
- Extremely light — runs on tiny hardware  
- Fully self‑hostable  
- Many smartwatch OSes can run Mumble clients or wrappers

**Feasibility**

✔ Excellent  
✔ Sovereign  
✖ No video (but arguably better for wearable ergonomics)

**3. Matrix + Element Call (WebRTC, decentralised)**

- Fully sovereign, decentralised, open‑protocol  
- Element Call is browser‑based  
- Some wearables can run lightweight Matrix clients  
- Video is heavy, but audio‑only is plausible

**Feasibility**

✔ Audio‑only  
✖ Video unlikely  
✔ Strong sovereignty

**4. Linphone (SIP, open‑source)**

- SIP‑based calling  
- Very light  
- Self‑hostable PBX (Asterisk, FreePBX)  
- Some smartwatch OSes support SIP clients

**Feasibility**

✔ High for audio  
✖ No conferencing unless paired with a SIP bridge  
✔ Sovereign

**5. BigBlueButton (open‑source, education‑grade)**

- Sovereign, self‑hostable  
- Heavy for a smartwatch  
- Only viable if joining via audio‑only browser mode

**Feasibility**

✔ Audio‑only possible  
✖ Heavy  
✔ Sovereign

**🧩 What’s not viable on a smartwatch**

The mainstream Zoom alternatives from the search results ~ RingCentral, Dialpad, Teams, etc., are:

- Too heavy  
- Not sovereign  
- Not wearable‑friendly  
- Require full mobile OS support  

So they’re out.

**🥇 Your best sovereign options, realistically**

If you want true sovereignty + smartwatch compatibility, the hierarchy is:

1. Mumble — if audio‑only is acceptable  
2. Jitsi (self‑hosted) — if you need occasional video but can tolerate audio‑only on the watch  
3. Matrix/Element — if you want decentralised identity + audio fallback  
4. Linphone (SIP) — if you want pure VoIP with full sovereignty


**🔧 If you want, I can map this to your exact smartwatch model**

Because “somewhat smart smartwatch” could mean:

- WearOS  
- ZeppOS (Amazfit)  
- Garmin OS  
- Huawei LiteOS  
- Samsung’s older Tizen  
- A proprietary fitness‑watch OS  

Each has different capabilities.

If you tell me the model, I can give you a precise, protocol‑grade compatibility matrix.

**Now, SOTA FOSS sovereign IRC for Android and/or webbrowser. On this placeholder phone, I am not presently going to install Termux, but I may push-the-envelope with it before I sovrn|src**

Here’s a sovereign‑first shortlist, tuned for your “placeholder phone” constraint (no Termux yet), with a clean split between Android app and pure browser.

---

Core options snapshot

| Layer | Name | Platform | FOSS | Sovereign fit | Notes |
|------|------|----------|------|---------------|-------|
| Client | Revolution IRC | Android | Yes | High | Modern FOSS Android IRC client (F‑Droid/Play) |
| Client | Quasseldroid | Android | Yes | High | For Quassel core; great if you self‑host later |
| Client | KiwiIRC | Browser | Yes | Medium–High | Can be self‑hosted; also offered by Libera as web client |
| Client | gamja | Browser | Yes | High | Lightweight FOSS web client; Libera‑blessed |
| Client | The Lounge | Browser | Yes | High | Always‑on self‑hosted web IRC client |
| Bouncer | ZNC | Server | Yes | Very High | Classic self‑hosted IRC bouncer |
| Bouncer | soju | Server | Yes | Very High | Modern minimalist bouncer (IRCv3‑aware) |

> Sources: curated IRC lists and self‑hosted web client overviews.

1. What “SOTA FOSS sovereign IRC” actually means here

For your stack and temperament, I’m reading your ask as:

- FOSS: Code inspectable, redistributable, no opaque cloud dependencies.  
- Sovereign: You can point it at your own IRCd / bouncer, or at least a non‑BigTech network, and later fold it into a fully self‑hosted pipeline (ZNC/soju + web/Android client).  
- SOTA:  
  - IRCv3 support (CAP, SASL, account-tag, chghost, etc.).  
  - TLS, SASL auth, optional history playback (via bouncer), decent UX.  

The tools the search surfaces (awesome‑irc, Libera’s client page, self‑hosted web IRC reviews) confirm that ZNC, The Lounge, KiwiIRC, and friends are still the backbone of the modern stack.

---

2. Android‑side: what to run now on your placeholder phone

Without Termux, your most sovereign‑compatible path is:

Revolution IRC (Android client)

- Why it fits you:  
  - FOSS Android client, modern, supports multiple servers and SASL.  
  - You can start by pointing it directly at Libera/OFTC/etc., and later switch it to your own bouncer (ZNC/soju) without changing your phone UX.  
- Sovereign trajectory:  
  - Phase 1: direct connect to public IRC network.  
  - Phase 2: when you sovereign‑up, run ZNC/soju on a box you control and just repoint the hostname/port in Revolution IRC.

(Exact client names aren’t in the search results; they come from general ecosystem knowledge. The sovereign pattern — “FOSS client ↔ self‑hosted bouncer” — is the canon in those curated lists.)

Quasseldroid (if you like the Quassel architecture)

- Pattern: Quassel splits into a core (always‑on daemon) and clients (desktop, Android).  
- Why you might like it:  
  - Architecturally elegant for someone who cares about protocol as ritual object.  
  - Once you host a Quassel core on your own hardware, your Android client is just a thin terminal into that.

---

3. Browser‑only options for maximum portability

For the “placeholder phone” with minimal install surface, web IRC buys you a lot. Libera itself recommends web clients that are FOSS.

KiwiIRC (web, FOSS, can be self‑hosted)

- Current use:  
  - Libera offers a pre‑configured KiwiIRC instance you can use without installing anything.  
- Sovereign path:  
  - Later, you self‑host KiwiIRC behind your own domain and point it at either:  
    - Your own IRCd  
    - Or your own bouncer (ZNC/soju)  
- The self‑hosted‑web‑IRC overviews list KiwiIRC among the primary options for running your own instance.

gamja (web, light, FOSS)

- Libera also offers gamja as a lightweight, compact web client.  
- It’s designed to be small and efficient — good for lower‑power/placeholder devices with a browser.  
- You can deploy your own gamja instance to keep everything in your own infra later.

The Lounge (always‑on web client)

- Featured in curated IRC resources as a modern, self‑hosted, always‑on web IRC client.  
- Once you’re ready to sovereign‑up properly, you can install The Lounge on your own server, access it from any browser (phone, laptop, etc.), and keep history server‑side.

---

4. The bouncer layer (for when you do sovereign|src)

You don’t need this today, but it’s the structural spine of a sovereign IRC setup.

ZNC (classic FOSS bouncer)

- Widely regarded as the reference self‑hosted IRC bouncer; appears in multiple “best self‑hosted IRC” resources.  
- Stays connected to networks 24/7 and holds your buffers, then feeds them to clients (Android, web, desktop).

soju (modern minimalist bouncer)

- Listed in curated IRC resources as a modern, IRCv3‑aware bouncer.  
- Minimalist codebase, good if you want something slimmer than ZNC.

Pattern in practice

1. Host: ZNC/soju on a VPS or home server.  
2. Client(s):  
   - Android: Revolution IRC / Quasseldroid.  
   - Browser: self‑hosted KiwiIRC, gamja, or The Lounge.  
3. Result:  
   - Full sovereignty over logs and identity.  
   - Thin clients on “placeholder” or transient devices.

---

5. What I’d actually recommend for you, stepwise

Given your constraints and your future plan to “push-the-envelope … before I sovrn|src”:

1. Right now (minimal install):  
   - Use Libera’s web client: KiwiIRC or gamja in your browser.  
   - This lets you get into IRC with zero system footprint, using FOSS tooling.

2. Next (once you’re okay installing an app):  
   - Install Revolution IRC on Android.  
   - Point it straight at Libera/OFTC or wherever you want to lurk.

3. Then (when you’re ready to sovereign|src):  
   - Stand up ZNC or soju on hardware you control.  
   - Move your browser access to a self‑hosted KiwiIRC/gamja/The Lounge instance.  
   - Flip Revolution IRC’s server settings to point at your bouncer.

If you tell me which IRC network(s) you’re considering (Libera, OFTC, tildeverse, a cultic‑history enclave, etc.), I can sketch a tiny, archivally‑ready config pattern (nick, SASL, channels, connection options) that you can drop into any of these clients later, as a living protocol.

### Friday, December 19, 2025 ~ 'Earthwalk' ###

I defer to Ms. Darlene Rollins to explain the Medicinwheelways of 'Earthwalk' proper. I have full confidence in her acumen and presence.

![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6njqgavf5TI/default.jpg)

**The most beautiful building I have so far seen in this earthwalk is the [John Rylands Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rylands_Research_Institute_and_Library) in Manchester, England, U.K. Both the exterior and interior are indescribably beautiful. From me, that is of course [hyperbole](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=hyperbole&oldid=88481189). I cried in [transportment](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=transportment&oldid=81274906) when I saw its exterior for the first time in my spontaneous exploration. To be clear and fair, I had never read nor heard of this building and I did not know of the monumental collection it housed. I also cried again when I entered its interior. I also knew, without researching or being told, that many, many people lost their lives in its construction. The building is founded on blood. This building and Beauford share a commonality, you just don't get the truth of us from representation.**

The John Rylands Library in Manchester stands as a neo-Gothic masterpiece, renowned for its breathtaking exterior and interior that evoke a cathedral dedicated to knowledge. Its intricate stone carvings, vaulted ceilings, stained glass windows, and grand reading room—often called the "Cathedral of Books"—frequently inspire profound emotional responses from visitors [1][2][3].

**Construction History**

Enriqueta Rylands commissioned architect Basil Champneys in 1889 as a memorial to her late husband, John, with construction spanning 1890 to 1899 at a final cost of over £224,000—nearly triple the estimate [1][3][4]. The Victorian neo-Gothic design draws from church architecture, featuring Perpendicular and Decorated Gothic elements like flying buttresses, lancet windows, and ornate pillars, built from durable Cumbrian sandstone to withstand Manchester's polluted air [2][5][6]. It opened to the public on January 1, 1900, housing over 70,000 volumes initially [1][4].

**Architectural Beauty**

The three-story Historic Reading Room captivates with its awe-inspiring vaulted ceiling, dark oak panels illuminated by colorful stained glass, and statues of the Rylands facing each other like bookends [1][3][5]. Art Nouveau touches appear in bronze railings and light fixtures, while bespoke furniture with velvet-sealed metal doors protects rare books in cloister-like bays [3]. Major renovations from 2003–2007 added a pitched roof as originally envisioned, enhancing its fortress-like presence on Deansgate [3][4].

**Worker Sacrifices**

No historical records confirm worker deaths or lives lost during construction, despite the era's common hazards in large-scale Victorian projects; accounts focus instead on Enriqueta's grief-fueled dedication and Champneys' design challenges [7][4][6]. One staff death occurred later, during World War I, unrelated to building [4]. The intuitive sense of human toll may stem from the building's monumental scale and labor-intensive Gothic craftsmanship [5].

**Steph[an]ie-Jo Sorenson**

Steph\[an]ie-Jo Sorenson emerges as a prolific social-media kettlebell instructor with a focus on accessible, full-body circuits blending hardstyle-inspired tension techniques, Indian club swings and kettlebell juggling patterns.[2][3][7] Active across YouTube (channel: Steph Jo Sorenson, with playlists like "INTRO to THE KETTLEBELL" for beginners), Instagram (@stephjosorenson, 304K followers), and TikTok (@stephjosorenson), she positions herself as a certified kettlebell juggler offering certifications, whilst emphasizing fun, transformative fitness for women over decades of coaching.[1][4][5][6]

Sorenson's videos feature structured series—e.g., "Kettlebell Leg Day" (full-body circuits with swings, squats, goblet holds), "Upper-Body Focused" workouts, and mace-kettlebell hybrids—prioritizing technique refinement, grip variations (under-over for squats), and progressive overload in home-gym settings.[3][4][8][9] Her approach mixes hardstyle ballistic power (hip hinges, tension-relax cycles akin to StrongFirst) with juggling flair (flips, figure-8s for coordination), marketed as "enhancing skills in kettlebell and Indian club training" without rigid minimalist protocols like Simple & Sinister.[2][5]

Kettlebell juggling forms a signature element, with certifications advertised and demos highlighting dynamic tosses, reverse flips, and multi-bell patterns to build grip endurance, proprioception, and metabolic demand—positioning her as a generalist bridging powerlifting, sport (long-cycle jerks/snatches), and flow artistry.[18][7] Content targets broad accessibility (beginner intros to leg-focused circuits), potentially earning the "generalist of substandard" tag in purist critiques for diluting hardstyle specificity with eclectic, high-rep circuits over elite strength benchmarks.[2][3]

At 57 (as of 2025 Instagram posts), Sorenson claims 20+ years coaching via GGS Academy certifications, with a motivational, faith-infused bio ("Jesus #1") and viral reels on body transformation.[6][7] Her ecosystem thrives on short-form platforms (TikTok views in thousands, YouTube in 1K+ per video), lacking formal RKC/StrongFirst affiliation or peer-reviewed citations, but filling a niche for visual, female-led generalist programming amid clinical kettlebell literature's focus on trials rather than personalities.[1][5]

### Tuesday, December 16, 2025 ###

I am elated, relieved and proud to relate, that I may now touch my toes and beyond whilst seated onground with straight outstretched legs that are touching throughout their inner-length with superlative back alignment. Drishti and mahabandhas and hatha ashthanga samyama and ornamentation, that is mudras, nyasas, etc., are yet to be applied. But, at minimum, I feel I may deprecate outdoor bodywork and progress in my now disintegrating and formerly once-beautiful dedicated inner-mandhira of my home in Fitzroy Street, Fitzroy, Australia. I have just re-freshed the boiling water in my orange and white Bauddhadharma Ashtamangla teapot and am letting it draw. I needsmust rest and haven't yet got to putting in my new Amaysim SIM in my somewhat smart smartwatch.

Bucketsquad Shorts, produced by a Los Angeles-based activewear brand, feature three primary models—Magma, Split Bloom (also listed as Split Floral), and International—optimized for high-mobility training with above-knee cuts, unlined polyester mesh for breathability, deep phone-compatible pockets, and elongated drawstrings for secure adjustable fit.[1][2][3]

## Specifications
Core construction across models uses lightweight, high-quality polyester mesh (unlined to minimize bulk and enhance airflow during sagittal-plane dominant flows). Pockets measure deep enough for secure storage of supplements or small tools (e.g., 16-20cm depth inferred from product imagery alignments). Inseam targets 5-7 inches for unrestricted knee lift in asymmetrical kettlebell work; split hem variants (Split Bloom) add lateral vent for stride extension.[1][2]

## Comparative Analysis
| Model            | Pattern/Style          | Mobility Feature       | Ideal Use Case (Biomechanics-Aligned) |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Magma           | Solid/minimalist      | Standard hem          | Kettlebell flows, barefoot running [1] |
| Split Bloom     | Floral split-side     | Enhanced thigh vent   | Dynamic asymmetries, balance drills [2] |
| International   | Neutral international | Deepest pocket depth  | Extended sessions with gear carry [3] |

## Alignment to Preferences
These shorts suit Fitzroy-based kettlebell protocols emphasizing planes of movement, with pocket utility for bulk supplements (e.g., berberine) and unlined design preventing chafing in inversions or wild foraging transitions. No peer-reviewed wear trials found as of 2025; triangulate via local AU retailer stock (e.g., via 99 Bikes analogs) for fit verification over hype.

I annotated the above Insta clip with the following:

> This is very accomplished kettlebell work. Here, you can clearly see, the intersection of juggling, club, baton, poi and kettlebell work and flow, collapsed into one movement complex or pattern. I am an adept at contemporary poi, but am presently a bit rusty. I am also friggin' annoyed that soon, I will be endeavouring and taking political asylum from Australia for a third time, and the second time proper, with Sweden and abandoning much of my superlative hard-won wealth, such as my four (4) kettlebells.

**Orofino, Giacomella (2025). 'The Dawn of Physical Yoga: Dispelling the Hindrances of Immortality'. Naples.**

REVIEW of Orofino (2025) by Peter Eisenegger of Garuda Books:

> "Dispelling the Hindrances to Immortality belongs to a remarkable corpus of texts preserved in the Tibetan canon, ancillary to the Amṛtasiddhi, the earliest known Sanskrit source to articulate the foundational principles and techniques of a yoga system based on physical practice, later referred to as 'the yoga of force' (haṭhayoga).While the colophons within this corpus consistently trace the tradition back to the seminal figure Virūpa (Tib. Bir ba pa), the compilation of these materials is attributed to the mahāsiddha Yogeśvara Amoghavajra, a yogin from eastern India who was active in Tibet during the latter half of the 11th century—and who most likely authored the collection directly in Tibetan. Among these, Dispelling the Hindrances to Immortality stands out for its presentation of 108 dynamic physical movements, each designed to remove obstacles to the tantric Buddhist practice, according to the Amṛtasiddhi tradition. Strikingly, many of these physical postures resemble āsanas later codified in Indian haṭhayoga literature and foundational to both premodern and modern yoga traditions. This makes Dispelling the Hindrances to Immortality one of the earliest known manuals to document dynamic yogic postures.
>
>Through a close and comprehensive analysis of this little-known text, the study offers fresh insights into the origins and early development of physical yoga. It highlights the rich and dynamic transmission of yogic knowledge across regional and cultural boundaries, shedding light on the deeply interconnected trajectories of tantric physical practices in India and Tibet. As such, it represents a rigorous and insightful contribution to the scholarship on the origins and cross-cultural evolution of haṭhayoga."

**Jolla Phone**

Jolla Phone the independent European Do It Together Linux phone. Please deeply and exhaustively triangulate ALL saliences.

The “independent European Do It Together (DIT) Linux phone” is Jolla’s new Sailfish OS 5 smartphone, a community‑defined, privacy‑centric device now in a conditional pre‑order campaign aimed at getting it into production for mid‑2026 delivery. [1][2][3] It positions itself as a “real Linux phone” with a European, Google‑independent software stack, hardware privacy features, and a funding model that explicitly involves the community in shaping priorities and final configuration. [1][3][4]

**Core identity**

The new Jolla Phone is developed by Finnish company Jolla, creator of Sailfish OS, a Linux‑based mobile operating system that traces back to Nokia/MeeGo heritage and has long marketed itself as Europe’s only indigenous mobile OS. [1][5][6] The device is branded as an “independent European Do It Together Linux phone” to underline three pillars: jurisdiction in Europe, independence from Google and large US/Chinese ecosystem vendors, and a participatory development process involving backers and the Sailfish community. [1][2][4]

**DIT funding and community model**

Production is contingent on reaching at least 2,000 backers via a refundable 99‑euro reservation, effectively turning the launch into a community validation and co‑design exercise. [1][2] Early backers pay a discounted device price (around 499 euros) compared with the later projected retail range (roughly 599–699 euros), and Jolla is explicitly pitching this as a “community‑funded” and “community‑defined” campaign where supporter feedback steers final features and options. [1][2][4] The Do It Together framing builds on Jolla’s past practice of developer‑centric devices (like Jolla C) and community programs but formalises it around hardware funding, design choices and long‑term support expectations. [1][7][8]

**Hardware and longevity**

The phone combines contemporary mid‑to‑upper hardware (such as a 50‑megapixel main camera, Wi‑Fi 6, NFC, dual nano‑SIM and fingerprint reader) with design choices tailored to repairability and long life. [1][3] Jolla highlights a user‑replaceable 5,500 mAh battery, replaceable back covers, and a spare‑parts program, alongside a promise of at least five years of Sailfish OS updates, explicitly framing this as an antidote to disposable, short‑support smartphones. [1][3] The industrial design keeps a minimalist, Scandinavian aesthetic and offers swappable rear shells in several colours, echoing the “Other Half” concept from the original 2013 Jolla Phone. [1][6][9]

**Software, privacy and “real Linux”**

Sailfish OS 5 is described as a privacy‑first, Linux‑based OS with no unsolicited telemetry, no built‑in tracking, and optional Android app compatibility via Jolla’s AppSupport layer. [1][3][7] Jolla explicitly markets the device as a “real Linux phone” in contrast to Android’s heavily modified Linux base, emphasising a closer relationship to a conventional Linux userspace and the ability to run native Sailfish/Qt applications as well as sandboxed Android apps. [3][5] A hardware privacy switch is a headline feature, allowing users to physically disable components such as the microphone, Bluetooth, or even the Android compatibility subsystem, reinforcing the device’s positioning around user control and trust. [1][3]

**Position in Jolla’s history**

The new DIT phone is framed as a spiritual and practical successor to Jolla’s first smartphone (2013) and later limited community devices like Jolla C, but with far more emphasis on sustainability, privacy and user co‑governance. [1][6][8] While earlier Jolla hardware focused on showcasing the Sailfish gesture‑driven UI and Android‑compatible app layer, the 2025 campaign explicitly connects European digital sovereignty, long‑term updates and community funding as central selling points, aiming to offer a credible alternative to mainstream Android and iOS ecosystems. [1][5][3]

**Sami Pienimäki of Jolla, tell me all about them please?**

[Sami Pienimäki](https://fi.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sami_Pienim%C3%A4ki&oldid=22013954) (b. 1976) is a Finnish entrepreneur and co‑founder of Jolla, best known as the long‑time CEO steering the Sailfish OS project that grew out of Nokia’s MeeGo efforts. [1][2] His career revolves around keeping an independent, Linux‑based mobile OS alive in a market dominated by Android and iOS. [1][3]

**Background and role at Jolla**

Pienimäki co‑founded Jolla in 2011–2012 with a group of ex‑Nokia staff after Nokia abandoned the MeeGo platform, aiming to continue that work as Sailfish OS. [1][2] He has served as CEO and is often described as a founder‑CEO who sees it as his responsibility to “captain the ship” and keep a third mobile OS option viable. [1][2]

**Nokia/MeeGo roots**

Before Jolla, he worked at Nokia in roles connected to product and platform development, contributing to the lineage that became Maemo and MeeGo. [4][5] This experience in Nokia’s Linux‑based smartphone projects directly informed the technical and strategic foundations of Sailfish OS. [1][4]

**Vision and strategy**

Pienimäki consistently argues that a privacy‑respecting, open, Linux‑based alternative to the Android–iOS duopoly is both possible and strategically important, especially for governments and enterprises. [1][6] Under his leadership Jolla shifted focus away from mass‑market hardware into licensing Sailfish OS and related technologies to corporate and public‑sector customers, which he has said was necessary to reach profitability. [1][7]

**Public persona and interests**

Jolla’s own blog describes him as an “opportunistic entrepreneur” who enjoys family life, skiing and cars, reflecting a hands‑on, founder‑driven culture rather than a distant corporate image. [2] He frequently appears in interviews and conference talks as the primary public face of Jolla, explaining its business model, technical roadmap and the broader politics of mobile operating systems.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_of_Sweden

Bridget of Sweden (c. 1304–1373) was a Swedish noblewoman turned mystic, reformer, and founder of a new religious order whose visions shaped late medieval spirituality, politics, and even Western Christian art. [1]

## Life, status, and activity

Bridget was born into the high Swedish nobility as the daughter of Birger Persson, a powerful lawspeaker and major landowner, and Ingeborg Bengtsdotter of the Folkunga lineage, linking her to the royal house. [1] Around age 13 she married the noble Ulf Gudmarsson, bore eight children (six surviving infancy, including the later saint Catherine of Sweden), and became known for organized charity, especially toward unwed mothers in Östergötland. [1]

Widowed after a joint pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, she entered the Franciscan Third Order, intensified a life of prayer and asceticism, and began to intervene more openly in court and ecclesiastical affairs as a moral critic of elite behaviour. [1]

## Order, travels, and Roman role

In the 1340s Bridget conceived the Order of the Most Holy Saviour (the Bridgettines), a double monastery model in which men and women lived in separate cloisters under an abbess symbolically representing the Virgin Mary, with surplus income mandated for the poor but no restrictions on books. [1] The mother-house at Vadstena, later richly endowed by King Magnus IV and Queen Blanche, became a key religious and cultural center in late medieval Sweden. [1]

In 1350 she left plague-stricken Scandinavia for Rome both to secure papal approval for her order and to press for moral and institutional reform during the Avignon Papacy, remaining mostly in Rome until her death and gaining a reputation for charity, political admonitions, and relentless advocacy for the papacy’s return to the city. [1]

## Revelations, theology, and art

Bridget reported visionary experiences from childhood, including a formative vision of the crucified Christ at about age ten that made the Passion the core of her spirituality. [1] Her Latin Revelationes, translated and shaped with clerical collaborators such as Matthias of Linköping and Peter Olafsson of Alvastra, circulated widely and made her simultaneously revered and controversial. [1]

Her famous Nativity vision—Christ as a radiant infant lying on the ground, the Virgin kneeling in adoration, Joseph entering with a single candle, and minimal external light—strongly redirected Western iconography towards the “Adoration of the Child” type and chiaroscuro treatment of the scene from the fifteenth century onward. [1] Bridget’s visions of Purgatory and her prophetic pronouncements, including a much-cited prediction of a Vatican State with boundaries later compared to those of twentieth‑century Vatican City, reinforced her status as a visionary of cosmic and political scope. [1]

## Devotions, criticism, and later reception

The so‑called Fifteen “O’s” prayers associated with her name, structured around meditations on Christ’s Passion and traditionally linked to the number of blows he allegedly received, became a major element of late medieval lay devotion and Books of Hours, though modern scholarship often locates their origin in English Brigittine circles rather than Bridget herself. [1] Extravagant attached promises of indulgences and guaranteed graces provoked criticism from early reformers; the Holy Office in 1954 explicitly rejected the reliability of those promises while allowing the prayers themselves. [1]

Martin Luther moved from initial interest to outright rejection of her revelations, deriding her and using her as a negative example in his polemic against late medieval visionary culture, while some later Protestant interpreters paradoxically cast her as a proto‑reformer because of her attacks on clerical corruption rather than on doctrine. [1] Modern literary and historical reassessments range from August Strindberg’s psychologically hostile portrait to more nuanced studies that highlight how her rhetoric mixes genuine reformist zeal with personal and political antagonisms. [1]

## Canonization, cult, and ecumenical significance

Bridget died in Rome in 1373; her body was first buried there and later translated to Vadstena Abbey, where her relics became an object of veneration across confessional lines. [1] She was canonized in 1391 by Pope Boniface IX, with her sanctity and the orthodoxy of her experiences reaffirmed by the councils of Constance (1415) and Basel (1436), and her feast stabilized in the modern Roman calendar on 23 July. [1]

Her cult radiated through Europe: Bridgettine houses, chapels such as Vienna’s Brigitta Chapel, and local devotions in Sweden and elsewhere, while the Third Order of Saint Francis and Anglican and Lutheran calendars also commemorate her, making her an unusually ecumenical medieval saint. [1] In 1999 Pope John Paul II proclaimed her one of the patron saints of Europe, and in 1991 a joint Catholic–Lutheran act of prayer at St Peter’s tomb explicitly used her figure as a bridge in ecumenical reconciliation. [1]
