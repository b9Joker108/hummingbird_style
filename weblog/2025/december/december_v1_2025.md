Orofino, is one of my godsisters or vajra-mantra-kin and a scholar, researcher, writer and Tibetologist of substandard, whom I hold in particular personal esteem and heart-warmth.

**Orofino, Giacomella (2025). 'The Dawn of Physical Yoga: Dispelling the Hindrances of Immortality'. Naples.**

REVIEW of Orofino (2025) by Peter Eisenegger of Garuda Books:

> "Dispelling the Hindrances to Immortality belongs to a remarkable corpus of texts preserved in the Tibetan canon, ancillary to the Amṛtasiddhi, the earliest known Sanskrit source to articulate the foundational principles and techniques of a yoga system based on physical practice, later referred to as 'the yoga of force' (haṭhayoga).While the colophons within this corpus consistently trace the tradition back to the seminal figure Virūpa (Tib. Bir ba pa), the compilation of these materials is attributed to the mahāsiddha Yogeśvara Amoghavajra, a yogin from eastern India who was active in Tibet during the latter half of the 11th century—and who most likely authored the collection directly in Tibetan. Among these, Dispelling the Hindrances to Immortality stands out for its presentation of 108 dynamic physical movements, each designed to remove obstacles to the tantric Buddhist practice, according to the Amṛtasiddhi tradition. Strikingly, many of these physical postures resemble āsanas later codified in Indian haṭhayoga literature and foundational to both premodern and modern yoga traditions. This makes Dispelling the Hindrances to Immortality one of the earliest known manuals to document dynamic yogic postures.
>
>Through a close and comprehensive analysis of this little-known text, the study offers fresh insights into the origins and early development of physical yoga. It highlights the rich and dynamic transmission of yogic knowledge across regional and cultural boundaries, shedding light on the deeply interconnected trajectories of tantric physical practices in India and Tibet. As such, it represents a rigorous and insightful contribution to the scholarship on the origins and cross-cultural evolution of haṭhayoga."

Pronunciation tips and study plan

- Pronunciation focus: German vowels are generally purer than English vowels. Practice e in Verlag (short, like 'e' in "bed") and the rolled or tapped r depending on dialect.  
- Weekly plan (4 weeks):  
  - Week 1: Core vocabulary and pronunciation (15–20 minutes daily).  
  - Week 2: Short bios and simple sentences; practice writing a 3‑sentence German bio.  
  - Week 3: Role‑play dialogues and phone/email phrases; record and compare.  
  - Week 4: Read product descriptions from a German bookshop and summarize in English and German.

Resources to use while studying: bilingual glossaries, short business bios in German, audio recordings of native speakers, and spaced‑repetition flashcards for vocabulary.

Final note: I integrated the German alongside English, explained grammar and vocabulary, and gave practical exercises you can use immediately. If you want, I can convert the practice into printable flashcards, create more dialogues tailored to buying/selling books, or build a four‑week lesson plan with daily micro‑tasks.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_of_Sweden

Bridget of Sweden (c. 1304–1373) was a Swedish noblewoman turned mystic, reformer, and founder of a new religious order whose visions shaped late medieval spirituality, politics, and even Western Christian art. [1]

## Life, status, and activity

Bridget was born into the high Swedish nobility as the daughter of Birger Persson, a powerful lawspeaker and major landowner, and Ingeborg Bengtsdotter of the Folkunga lineage, linking her to the royal house. [1] Around age 13 she married the noble Ulf Gudmarsson, bore eight children (six surviving infancy, including the later saint Catherine of Sweden), and became known for organized charity, especially toward unwed mothers in Östergötland. [1]

Widowed after a joint pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, she entered the Franciscan Third Order, intensified a life of prayer and asceticism, and began to intervene more openly in court and ecclesiastical affairs as a moral critic of elite behaviour. [1]

## Order, travels, and Roman role

In the 1340s Bridget conceived the Order of the Most Holy Saviour (the Bridgettines), a double monastery model in which men and women lived in separate cloisters under an abbess symbolically representing the Virgin Mary, with surplus income mandated for the poor but no restrictions on books. [1] The mother-house at Vadstena, later richly endowed by King Magnus IV and Queen Blanche, became a key religious and cultural center in late medieval Sweden. [1]

In 1350 she left plague-stricken Scandinavia for Rome both to secure papal approval for her order and to press for moral and institutional reform during the Avignon Papacy, remaining mostly in Rome until her death and gaining a reputation for charity, political admonitions, and relentless advocacy for the papacy’s return to the city. [1]

## Revelations, theology, and art

Bridget reported visionary experiences from childhood, including a formative vision of the crucified Christ at about age ten that made the Passion the core of her spirituality. [1] Her Latin Revelationes, translated and shaped with clerical collaborators such as Matthias of Linköping and Peter Olafsson of Alvastra, circulated widely and made her simultaneously revered and controversial. [1]

Her famous Nativity vision—Christ as a radiant infant lying on the ground, the Virgin kneeling in adoration, Joseph entering with a single candle, and minimal external light—strongly redirected Western iconography towards the “Adoration of the Child” type and chiaroscuro treatment of the scene from the fifteenth century onward. [1] Bridget’s visions of Purgatory and her prophetic pronouncements, including a much-cited prediction of a Vatican State with boundaries later compared to those of twentieth‑century Vatican City, reinforced her status as a visionary of cosmic and political scope. [1]

## Devotions, criticism, and later reception

The so‑called Fifteen “O’s” prayers associated with her name, structured around meditations on Christ’s Passion and traditionally linked to the number of blows he allegedly received, became a major element of late medieval lay devotion and Books of Hours, though modern scholarship often locates their origin in English Brigittine circles rather than Bridget herself. [1] Extravagant attached promises of indulgences and guaranteed graces provoked criticism from early reformers; the Holy Office in 1954 explicitly rejected the reliability of those promises while allowing the prayers themselves. [1]

Martin Luther moved from initial interest to outright rejection of her revelations, deriding her and using her as a negative example in his polemic against late medieval visionary culture, while some later Protestant interpreters paradoxically cast her as a proto‑reformer because of her attacks on clerical corruption rather than on doctrine. [1] Modern literary and historical reassessments range from August Strindberg’s psychologically hostile portrait to more nuanced studies that highlight how her rhetoric mixes genuine reformist zeal with personal and political antagonisms. [1]

## Canonization, cult, and ecumenical significance

Bridget died in Rome in 1373; her body was first buried there and later translated to Vadstena Abbey, where her relics became an object of veneration across confessional lines. [1] She was canonized in 1391 by Pope Boniface IX, with her sanctity and the orthodoxy of her experiences reaffirmed by the councils of Constance (1415) and Basel (1436), and her feast stabilized in the modern Roman calendar on 23 July. [1]

Her cult radiated through Europe: Bridgettine houses, chapels such as Vienna’s Brigitta Chapel, and local devotions in Sweden and elsewhere, while the Third Order of Saint Francis and Anglican and Lutheran calendars also commemorate her, making her an unusually ecumenical medieval saint. [1] In 1999 Pope John Paul II proclaimed her one of the patron saints of Europe, and in 1991 a joint Catholic–Lutheran act of prayer at St Peter’s tomb explicitly used her figure as a bridge in ecumenical reconciliation. [1]
