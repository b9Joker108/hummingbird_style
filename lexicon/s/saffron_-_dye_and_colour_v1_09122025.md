# Saffron: Dye, Colour, Historicity and Aestheticism — An Introduction #

What is the complementary colour to Saffron; technically, specifically and exactly, on the Colourwheel?

On a standard hue-based colour wheel, saffron sits in the yellow–orange sector, around hex values such as #F4C430 or #FFAC00. [4][6] The technically complementary hue is therefore a saturated blue–violet/cobalt-blue opposite it, commonly approximated around hex #0053FF (luminous vivid cobalt blue). [3][9]
