Please triangulate the historicity and spatio-temporal development of: shat-sampat (six treasures of virtue).

Shat-sampat, the "six treasures of virtue," is a classical grouping in Advaita Vedānta and is foundational to the soteriological program articulated in Jñāna Yoga and the Sādhana Chatuṣṭaya (the Four Pillars or Requisites for Knowledge)[1][2][3]. Its historicity is deeply entwined with the development of early Indian philosophical traditions, particularly those related to renunciation and mental discipline, and its spatio-temporal spread reflects the diffusion of Vedānta ideas across sub-regions of South Asia from the late first millennium CE[1][2]. 

### Core Historicity
- The concept of shat-sampat is most clearly spelled out in major Advaita Vedānta texts, especially in commentarial traditions on the Upaniṣads, Bhagavad Gītā, and codified through later works of teachers such as Śaṅkara, Sureshvara, and Vidyaranya[2][3][1].
- There is little evidence for an explicit "sixfold" grouping in Vedic Samhitās themselves, but their elements (restraint, endurance, faith, sense-control) appear more diffusely in Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, suggesting the grouping crystallized between the early Upaniṣadic and classical Vedānta periods (roughly 4th century BCE to 8th century CE)[2][3].

### Spatio-Temporal Development
- The crystallization of shat-sampat likely occurred in the heartland of classical Vedānta (Central and South Indian regions), especially where monastic institutions and Advaita lineages flourished, like Kanchipuram, Sringeri, and Varanasi[2][3].
- Over centuries, shat-sampat and the broader Sādhana Chatuṣṭaya schema were referenced, codified, and ritualized as prerequisites for spiritual study not only in Advaita, but also in some non-dual Shaiva, Vaishnava, and even tantric manuals, though the exact sixfold arrangement is most consistent in Vedānta[1][2].
- The schema was carried further by medieval itinerant teachers and manuscript traditions, becoming embedded in monastic curricula as both mental training and a social ethic for aspirants[3][2].

### List and Function of the Six Treasures
| Virtue  | Meaning | Primary Source Domain | Core Function | Region of Classical Formalization |
|---------|---------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Sama    | Calmness/restraint of mind | Advaita, classical Vedānta [2][3][1] | Enduring internal equanimity | South/Central India |
| Dama    | Control of senses          | Advaita, Vedānta [2][3][1]        | Sensory discipline        | South/Central India |
| Uparati | Renunciation/dispassion    | Vedānta, later Yoga [1]                    | Withdrawal from non-duty   | Classical India zone |
| Titiksha| Forbearance/endurance      | Vedānta [2][3][1]                | Persevere through hardship | All Vedānta centers |
| Shraddha| Faith/trust in scripture   | Vedānta [2][3][1]                | Confidence in teaching     | Pan-Indian diffusion |
| Samadhana| One-pointedness/focus      | Vedānta [2][3][1]                | Mental concentration       | Vedānta heartland    |

### Comparative and Intertextual Notes
- Although the sixfold shat-sampat is typical to Vedānta, analogous groupings (e.g., Buddhist śīla-paramita, yogic yamas/niyamas) suggest possible regional cross-pollinations in the South Asian subcontinent between 3rd–10th centuries CE, though shat-sampat is uniquely six and embedded in a specific soteriological sequence in Advaita[1][3][2].
- The term "sampat" itself denotes wealth or treasure in multiple puranic and itihasic sources; only in the Vedantic context does it shift metaphorically to virtue rather than material richness[4].

### Summary Table: Spatio-Temporal Map of Shat-Sampat

| Period         | Core Regions           | Textual Standardization         | Interactions                | Transmission Modality    |
|----------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Upanishadic (4C BCE+) | North, Central India  | Fragmentary, pre-grouped        | Intersecting with samnyasa  | Oral recitation/manuals |
| Classical Vedanta (8–13C CE) | South, Central India | Definitive grouping in commentaries | Monastic and itinerant usage | Manuscript, oral, institutional |
| Medieval–Modern (13C+ CE) | Pan-Indian, Nepal, Southeast Asia | Social/ritual proliferation    | Absorption in later doctrines | Monastic, scholastic, literary  |

Shat-sampat thus is a Vedantic refinement of earlier ethical formulations, fully systematized in the classical Advaita period and propagated through monastic and scholastic modalities, with elements parallel but not identical to Buddhist and Yoga systems. The specific sixfold set is reliably traceable to South and Central Indian Vedantic centers from the early medieval epoch onwards[1][2][3][4].

| Sanskrit Term | Devanagari | IAST                    | English Meaning       | Academic Pronunciation        | Lay Pronunciation         | Etymology & Linguistic Deep Dive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------|------------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dama          | दम         | dama                    | Self-control, restraint | /d̪əˈmɑː/                   | "dah-ma"                  | Derived from root दामयति (dāmyati) meaning "to tame or subdue". Cognate to English “tame,” Greek δαμνήμι (damnêmi), Latin domō. Semiotically, it denotes mastery over the senses and impulses, emphasizing control and discipline—core to yogic and Vedantic ethical frameworks. This term appears widely in ancient texts as an essential moral discipline.                                                                                      |
| Sama          | सम         | sama                    | Calmness, equanimity  | /səˈmɑː/                     | "sah-mah"                 | Derived from Proto-Indo-Iranian *samHás* and Proto-Indo-European *somHós*, meaning "same" or "even." It denotes mental calm or balance, a state of inner equality or steadiness. The term connotes sameness or equal-mindedness, foundational in meditative and ethical contexts. Across Sanskrit literature, it represents tranquillity, a mind not disturbed by dualities.                                                                                                          |
| Samadhana     | समाधान      | samādhāna               | Concentration, focus  | /səˈmɑːd̪ʱɑːnə/             | "sah-mah-dhaa-nah"        | From the root सम् (sam, "together") + आधार (ādhāra, "foundation"). Literally meaning “bringing together,” “composition,” or “settling.” Used in Yogic and Vedantic contexts to mean one-pointedness of mind or mental synthesis. Linguistically, it represents a union or resolution, signaling cognitive fixation or absorption, essential for meditative practices.                                                                                                                    |
| Shraddha      | श्रद्धा     | śraddhā                 | Faith, trust          | /ʃrəd̪ˈd̪ʱɑː/               | "shruh-dhaa"              | Derived from √श्रद्ध (śrad'dha) related to "trust" or “belief.” It connotes a heart-based conviction, especially faith in scriptures and spiritual truths. This term is etymologically connected with notions of sincerity and confidence, essential for scriptural acceptance and practice. Semiotic layers extend to ritual faith (śrāddha) acts performed for ancestors, highlighting trust as a pluralistic concept in Indic traditions.                                                           |
| Titiksha      | तितिक्षा    | titikṣā                 | Forbearance, endurance | /tɪt̪ɪkˈʂɑː/                | "ti-tik-shaa"             | From √तृष् (tṛṣ) meaning "to suffer," plus prefix ति (ti, "to cut or endure"). Conveys toleration or patient endurance, especially of suffering or hardship, without agitation. Titiksha is linguistically linked to ideas of tolerance and perseverance. Semiotics emphasize resilience and the yogic virtue of accepting difficulties without disturbance, forming a crucial component of the spiritual path.                                                                |
| Uparati       | उपरति      | uparati                 | Renunciation, cessation| /uːˈpərəti/                  | "oo-pah-ruh-tee"          | Composed of उप (upa, "near") + root रि (rī, "to go or adhere"). Means stopping or withdrawal, cessation of external actions or desires. Etymologically denotes a turning away from worldly engagements, thus symbolizing renunciation or dispassion. It denotes inner withdrawal and quietism, foundational for contemplative or renunciant traditions. Often contrasted with vikalpa (worldly diversions).                                                                                     |

### Additional Notes on Linguistic and Semiotic Context:
- All terms are classical Sanskrit, preserved in canonical Advaita Vedānta and Yoga texts.
- Phonetically, the academic pronunciations follow IAST norms with dental stops and retroflex consonants, while lay pronunciations approximate these with easier phonetics.
- Etymologies reflect Proto-Indo-European roots and Indo-Iranian language heritage, showing deep Indo-European linguistic genealogies.
- Semiotics emphasize their metaphysical and ethical functions: restraint, equanimity, faith, endurance, renunciation—each a "treasure" for spiritual aspirants.

This lexicon provides a foundation for scholarly exploration, linking phonetic, morphological, etymological, and symbolic dimensions of each term.
