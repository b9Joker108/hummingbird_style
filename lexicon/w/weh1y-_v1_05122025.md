# \*weh₁y- #

https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/weh%E2%82%81y-   Do your best in mapping the spatiotemporal cascades and attestations of the development of this etymological root throughout the IE Language Family

The root *weh₁y- belongs to a very old Indo-European “bending / twining / turning” semantic field, and its descendants spread into at least Indo-Iranian, Celtic, Balto-Slavic, Germanic and Slavic, with probable extensions into the “vine/wine” complex. [1]

## Core meaning and morphology

The reconstructed *weh₁y- is usually glossed with senses such as “to wind, twist, plait, bend, turn,” and serves as the base for various present, aorist and noun formations. [1] The chief semantic trajectory is from physical torsion or curvature (twining, bending, turning) into concrete products or objects characterized by bending (twigs, willows, walls, vines, whirls). [1]

### Key PIE derivatives

- *uh₁y-éye-ti: iterative/éye-present “to wrap, plait,” maintaining the core verbal semantics of twisting and interlacing. [1]
- *wéh₁i-mn̥ ~ *uh₁i-mén-s: action nouns “plaiting,” abstracting the process of weaving/twining. [1]
- *weh₁i-ro-s: an adjectival formation “turned, twisted,” generalized to describe anything marked by curvature or torsion. [1]

## Indo-Iranian and Celtic developments

Proto-Indo-Iranian reflects the root in a continued verb of “twisting/bending,” showing direct continuity with the PIE verbal base. [1]

- Proto-Indo-Iranian *wináHti: preserves a verb “he twists / bends,” extending the PIE physical manipulation sense. [1]

In the northwestern continuum, Proto-Celtic shows an innovation where “bending/enclosing” becomes a more spatial, enclosing notion.

- Proto-Celtic *winīti (also *winati): “to bend, enclose,” shifting from the manner of movement (twisting) to the resultant configuration (enclosure or curvature). [1]
Spatiotemporally, this Celtic development represents the westward branch of the root, likely Early 1st millennium BCE or earlier at the Proto-Celtic stage, later diffusing into Insular Celtic lexica as inherited or fossilized formations. [1]

## Balto-Slavic whirl and curvature

The Balto-Slavic area preserves a particularly rich cluster, where twisting and turning are exploited into iterative verbs and noun formations tied to motion (whirling) and shaped 

objects (branches, shoots). [1]

- Proto-Balto-Slavic *wīˀtei: a verbal formation (cf. zero-grade *uh₁i-t) continuing the “to wind / to twist” sense. [1]
- Proto-Balto-Slavic *weiˀš- and its derivatives:  
  - *weiˀšā́ˀtei: denominative or iterative verb, “to whirl, to spin,” emphasizing continuous rotational movement. [1]
  - *weiˀšuras, *weiˀšulas: nouns glossable as “whirlwind,” concretizing twisting motion in atmospheric phenomena. [1]
- Proto-Balto-Slavic *waiˀn-: a nominal base which yields diminutives *waiˀníkas, *waiˀnukas, likely denoting curved or vine-like shoots, tying the root into vegetal morphology. [1]

Within Slavic, curvature and turning remain salient:

- Proto-Slavic *vixati: a verb “to twist, turn” (with some nuance of repeated or effortful action), continuing the Balto-Slavic verb series from *wīˀtei-type formations. [1]
- Proto-Slavic *vojь “curve, turn”: a noun expressing “bend, curve,” illustrating the nominalization of the root’s spatial geometry. [1]

## Germanic walls and enclosures

In Proto-Germanic, the semantic focus shifts from the act of twisting to the result: woven barriers and enclosing structures. [1]

| Stage                | Form         | Approx. meaning                 | Semantic step                                            |
|----------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| PIE                   | *weh₁y-      | to twist, wind, plait          | base action of bending/twisting                          |
| Proto-Germanic        | *waigaz      | a wall                          | “that which is woven/twined into a barrier” [1]     |
| Proto-Germanic        | *wajjuz      | a wall                          | parallel or derived formation for “woven enclosure” [1] |

The “wall” here is best understood as an originally wattle-like, plaited fence, where twined materials (branches, withies) manifest the root’s twisting semantics in architecture and landscape delimitation. [1]

## Willows, branches, vine and wine

A further development ties the root to arboreal and viticultural domains across space and time. [1]

- *wéh₁i-ti-s ~ *uh₁i-téy-s: “willow; that which twines or bends,” a botanical noun encoding characteristic flexibility and curvature of willow branches. [1]
- *woh₁y-éh₂: “branch, twig,” a direct nominal of small, bendable offshoots. [1]

There is also a debated connection to the “wine” complex:

- *woyh₁-n-, *uh₁y-ḗn (possibly), and *wéyh₁-ō ~ *wih₁-n-és “(product of the vine >) wine” are sometimes linked to *weh₁y-, suggesting a semantic pathway: “twining plant (vine) → its product (grapes/wine).” [1]
- Balto-Slavic *waiˀn- and its derivatives align structurally with this vine/wine nexus, although the exact historical pathways are contested and not universally accepted. [1]

Spatiotemporally, this cluster would originate in early agricultural settings of the PIE speech community where climbing, twining plants (vines, willows) were salient, later radiating into the southern (Indo-Iranian), western (Celtic, Italo-Balto-Slavic) and northwestern (Germanic) branches, each elaborating different ecological and cultural aspects of twisting: fences, whirlwinds, curved paths, pliable wood, and viticulture.
