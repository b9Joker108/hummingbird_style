In Neuroscience discourse, "rate-coded strength" (or rate coding/frequency coding), refers to the mechanism by which the intensity of a stimulus or the magnitude of a motor command is encoded by the frequency (rate) of action potentials (nerve impulses) fired by a neuron. 

* Mechanism: While the amplitude of an action potential is constant (an all-or-nothing principle), the rate at which these potentials are generated varies.
* Stimulus Intensity: A weak stimulus or a low-force requirement results in a low firing rate. A stronger stimulus or a greater demand for force leads to a higher, more rapid firing rate of action potentials.
* Muscle Force Control: In the neuromuscular system, rate coding is crucial for controlling muscle force. The central nervous system increases muscle force by recruiting more motor units and increasing their discharge rates (pulses per second, pps). Higher firing rates lead to a more fused, or tetanic, muscle contraction, which generates more force.
* Training Adaptation: Strength training can lead to adaptations that improve the nervous system's ability to produce faster rate coding and more synchronous firing of motor units, thereby increasing the maximum force a person can generate, especially during rapid, explosive movements.
