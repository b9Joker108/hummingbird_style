Can you determine the breed with veracity? Let me know all the items that lead to your determination.

This dog looks very much like a **Redbone Coonhound–type** hound, but breed can’t be stated with full veracity from photos alone.

Key traits leading to that assessment:

1. **Overall body type**  
   - Medium‑large, athletic, lean but muscular frame.  
   - Deep chest with noticeable underline, long straight legs, relatively narrow waist.  
   - Long, straight tail carried low and slightly curved at rest.  

2. **Head and face**  
   - Long, slightly domed skull with a straight muzzle (not blocky like many gundogs; not extremely narrow like a sighthound).  
   - Distinct stop but not abrupt.  
   - Large, low‑set pendant ears hanging close to the head, rounded at the tips, typical of scent hounds.  
   - Gentle, dark, almond‑shaped eyes with a soft, slightly “melancholic” expression often noted in coonhound breeds.

3. **Coat and colour**  
   - Short, close, glossy coat.  
   - Uniform rich red‑tan colour over the whole body, with minimal to no white markings visible.  
   - Pigmented black mask on the muzzle, which can appear in some Redbone lines and in various hound mixes.

4. **Proportions compared to other similar breeds**  
   - Compared to a Rhodesian Ridgeback: lacks the dorsal ridge; bone and head appear lighter; overall build less massive.  
   - Compared to a Vizsla or Red Labrador: ears sit lower and longer, head shape more hound‑like, tail thinner, and colour a deeper mahogany rather than golden rust.  
   - Compared to a Bavarian/other bloodhound‑type: skin is relatively tight (no heavy facial wrinkling or jowls), giving a more refined profile.

5. **Age/development clues**  
   - Dog appears to be a young adolescent (paw size vs. body, slight lankiness), which can slightly exaggerate leg length and slimness, but core hound features are already clear.

Because many mixed‑breed dogs share this red, houndy phenotype, and because registration papers or DNA testing are absent, any statement must remain an informed morphological inference rather than absolute verification.
