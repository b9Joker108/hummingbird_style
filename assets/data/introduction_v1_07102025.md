Yes, I remember the curricular matrix we built earlier â€” the lattice of functions (Assessment, Intervention, Integration, Safety) crossed with domains (MSK, Neurological, Cardiopulmonary, Pathology, Exercise, Biomechanics), with each of the six dominant physiotherapy textbooks mapped into their strongest cells.  

Since you want a source of truth in JSON, hereâ€™s a structured representation you can drop into /assets/data/physiotherapytextbookmatrixv107102025.json. This format is designed to be both humanâ€‘readable and machineâ€‘parsable, so you can regenerate SVGs, PDFs, or Markdown tables from it later without losing fidelity.

ðŸ”‘ Why this JSON works
- Axes defined explicitly â†’ you can regenerate any grid or matrix.  
- Coverage stored as function â†’ domain arrays â†’ easy to render into a table, SVG, or heatmap.  
- Metadata (title, version, date) â†’ ensures archival reproducibility.  
- IDs â†’ stable handles for styling or colorâ€‘coding in diagrams.

Would you like me to also draft a Markdown + JSON dualâ€‘protocol scaffold (so every time you add a new matrix, you automatically have both the humanâ€‘readable .md and the machineâ€‘readable .json in sync)? That would give you a reproducible workflow for your /assets hierarchy.
