...

Great move, Beauford — setting up a clean /assets hierarchy early saves you headaches later. Since you already have /images, /graphemes, and /fonts, here’s a reproducible, documentation‑ready set of additional subdirectories that are common in well‑structured repos:

---

📂 Suggested /assets Subdirectories

| Subdirectory | Purpose | Notes for Archival Clarity |
|--------------|---------|----------------------------|
| /icons | Small symbolic graphics (SVGs, PNGs) distinct from full images | Keeps UI glyphs separate from illustrative images |
| /logos | Project or partner logos | Useful if you need to track licensing/attribution separately |
| /audio | Sound files (alerts, narration, music) | If your project has any multimedia component |
| /video | Short clips, demos, animations | Keep compressed formats here; document codecs used |
| /docs or /pdfs | Static reference documents, diagrams, whitepapers | Distinct from source code documentation |
| /styles | CSS, SCSS, or design tokens | Sometimes grouped under /assets if not in /src |
| /data | Static JSON, CSV, or YAML files bundled with the repo | For reproducible examples, fixtures, or demo content |
| /svg | Raw vector files (if you want them apart from raster images) | Helps when you want to diff or optimize them separately |

🧭 Archival/Protocol Notes
- Granularity matters: separating /icons, /logos, and /images prevents flattening of meaning — you can document provenance and licensing per category.  
- Reproducibility: always include a README.md inside /assets that explains directory purpose, file formats, and any licensing/attribution requirements.  
- Diff‑friendly formats: prefer SVG, JSON, YAML where possible; they’re easier to track in Git than binaries.

👉 If you want, I can sketch a canonical directory tree (with comments inline) that you could drop straight into your repo as a reproducible scaffold. Would you like me to draft that?

Isn't diagram, table, etc., subsumed within grapheme?

That’s a sharp ontological question, Beauford — and it hinges on how strictly you want to define grapheme in your archival taxonomy.  

---

🧾 Grapheme vs. Diagram/Table

- Grapheme (strict linguistic sense)  
  - The smallest unit of a writing system (e.g., a letter, character, or symbol).  
  - In Unicode and philology, a grapheme is atomic: “a” vs. “á” vs. “ä” are distinct graphemes.  
  - By this definition, a diagram or table is not a grapheme, but an arrangement of graphemes (plus spatial relations, lines, and formatting).  

- Grapheme (extended archival sense)  
  - If you’re using /graphemes as a bucket for symbolic forms (characters, glyphs, ideograms, notation systems), then yes — diagrams and tables could be composite graphemic structures.  
  - A table is essentially a matrix of graphemes with rules of alignment.  
  - A diagram is a graphical syntax of graphemes (arrows, nodes, labels).  

---

📂 Why You Might Still Separate Them

- Reproducibility:  
  - /graphemes → atomic units (alphabets, logograms, phonetic marks, mathematical symbols).  
  - /diagrams or /tables → composite structures that use graphemes but add layout, relational syntax, and often semantic conventions.  

- Diff‑friendliness:  
  - Graphemes are often stored as fonts, SVG glyphs, or Unicode mappings.  
  - Tables and diagrams are more often stored as structured text (Markdown, LaTeX, CSV) or vector drawings.  

- Archival clarity:  
  - If you collapse everything into /graphemes, you risk flattening meaning: the distinction between “atomic symbol” and “composite structure” disappears.  
  - Keeping them separate lets you document provenance and conventions at the right granularity.  

---

🧭 Protocol Suggestion
- Use /graphemes for atomic symbolic units (letters, glyphs, notation marks).  
- Use /diagrams (or /figures) for composite symbolic structures (flowcharts, schematics, correspondence tables).  
- Use /tables if you want to treat tabular structures as their own reproducible form.  

That way, your /assets tree mirrors the linguistic hierarchy:  
- Grapheme → Word → Sentence → Table/Diagram → Document.  

---

Would you like me to draft a canonical directory tree that explicitly encodes this hierarchy (from grapheme up to document), so you can drop it into your repo as a reproducible scaffold? That would make the distinction operational rather than just theoretical.
