# Versioning and Quality Control #

This repository applies a single, explicit governance model to all GitHub Flavored Markdown (*.md) documents. It defines default status, quality control, and the conditions under which a document is considered authoritative.

---

Policy overview

- Default posture: All Markdown documents are provisional unless explicitly promoted via frontmatter.
- Authority condition: A document is authoritative only when it declares both a recognized status and quality control level in frontmatter.
- Frontmatter location: YAML frontmatter appears at the very beginning of the file, delimited by triple dashes.

---

Required frontmatter keys and controlled vocabulary

- Status: Editorial state of the document.
  - Allowed values: draft, review, final, canonical, deprecated.
- Quality_Control: Verification depth and audit trail.
  - Required subkeys:
    - level: none, internal-review, peer-reviewed, archival-certified
    - reviewer: Named person(s) or body
    - date: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
    - checks: List of concrete checks performed (orthography, citations, crosswalks)
    - notes: Short rationale or scope of verification

> A document is authoritative only if status is final or canonical and Quality_Control.level is peer-reviewed or archival-certified.

Minimal and authoritative templates

- Minimal template (provisional by default):
  `yaml
  ---
  title: "Document title"
  status: "draft"
  Quality_Control:
    level: "none"
    reviewer: ""
    date: ""
    checks: []
    notes: ""
  ---
  `

- Authoritative template (meets repository benchmark):
  `yaml
  ---
  title: "Document title"
  status: "final"
  Quality_Control:
    level: "peer-reviewed"
    reviewer: "Editorial Board"
    date: "2025-10-22"
    checks:
      - "Orthography verified (script + transliteration)"
      - "Terminology cross-checked against canonical sources"
      - "Internal consistency + citation audit"
    notes: "Meets repository benchmark for authoritative publication."

Interpretation rules

- Provisional default: Any Markdown file lacking frontmatter or a recognized status value is deemed provisional and non-binding.
- Quality neutrality: Absence of Quality_Control implies no formal verification; do not infer rigor.
- Canonical elevation: Only status: canonical indicates long-term stewardship and cross-repository adoption, and it still requires qualifying Quality_Control.level.
- Deprecation: status: deprecated indicates superseded content; retain for archival traceability, not for active reliance.

---

Compliance, audit, and change management

- Compliance requirement: Contributions must include the required frontmatter keys and use controlled vocabulary values.
- Audit trail: Changes to status or Quality_Control require a commit message that states the reason and scope of the update.
- Version signal: Elevation to final or canonical must be accompanied by a dated Quality_Control entry and an enumerated checklist of checks performed.
- Crosswalks: Where variant orthographies or transliterations exist, include a frontmatter variants: list for reproducible mapping; variants never substitute for status or quality declarations.

One-paragraph benchmark clause

All GFM (*.md) documents in this repository are provisional by default. A document is authoritative only when its YAML frontmatter declares status: final or canonical and a Quality_Control block whose level is peer-reviewed or archival-certified, together with reviewer, date, and an explicit checklist of completed verification steps. Absent these declarations, no document should be treated as definitive, complete, or binding.
